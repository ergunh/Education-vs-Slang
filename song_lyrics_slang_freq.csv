24,"1, 2 Many",Luke Combs,"1, 2 Many Lyrics[Verse 1: Luke Combs]
Well I got a call from Rowdy ‘round six o'clock
Sayin' he caught a hankerin’ for a honky tonk
Wants an ice cold beer and a country song
But he didn't want to stay out all night long
Well I ain't the kind to let a buddy drink alone
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open
The tick-tock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past 10 I'm half past tipsy
And quarter to 12, man I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hits me
5-4-3-2-1 too many

[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
After five diet Millers I was feelin' loose
Singin' karaoke to a TL tune
When a pretty little thing shot me a wink
She said, ""Hey cowboy, could you buy us a drink?""
Well hey, baby doll, I will if you want
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open
The tick-tock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past 10 I'm half past tipsy
And quarter to 12, man I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hits me
5-4-3-2-1 too many
[Bridge: Luke Combs, Brooks & Dunn]
C'mon
Now I've never been the kind to quit
Won't stop 'til I get to the bottom of this
And the night's still young so whatcha say we shotgun one?
Hell we'll shoot one with you Luke, come on Ronnie

[Chorus: Brooks & Dunn, Luke Combs]
There's no stoppin' me once I get to goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open
The tick-tock of that clock is like a time bomb
About half past 10 I'm half past tipsy
And quarter to 12, man, I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hit me
5-4-3-2-1 too many
Yeah, 5-4-3-2-1 too many

43,11 Minutes,YUNGBLUD,"11 Minutes Lyrics[Chorus: Halsey]
I'm 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day
I'm 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?

[Verse 1: Halsey & YUNGBLUD]
I think I missed you callin' on the other line
I'm just thinkin' all these thoughts up in my mind
Talkin' love but I can't even read the signs
I would sell my soul for a bit more time
You stain all on my body like you're red wine
You're the fuckin' acid to my alkaline
You run your middle finger up and down my spine
I'm sorry there was no one to apologize
I'm so fuckin' sorry, I'm so fuckin' sorry
I've been playing somebody and it's helping nobody
And her lipstick arithmetic didn't stick
And now I'm sick, throwing fits
And yeah, I've seen you in my head every fuckin' day since I left
You on the floor with your hands 'round your head
And I'm down and depressed
All I want is your head on my chest
Touchin' feet in my bed

[Chorus: Halsey & YUNGBLUD]
I'm 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day
I'm 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?
You're 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day
You're 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?
[Bridge: Halsey]
Tell me what you need
I can make you more than what you are
Come and lay the roses on the floor
Every single Sunday, don't get bored
I just want to freeze
I can give you more than what you are
Now I see you standing all alone
I never thought the world would turn to stone

[Refrain: Halsey & YUNGBLUD]
So call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fuckin' with my head
Call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fuckin' with my head

[Chorus: Halsey & YUNGBLUD]
I'm 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day
I'm 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?
(Why aren't you here?)
You're 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day
You're 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?
(Why aren't you here?)
[Refrain: YUNGBLUD]
So call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fuckin' with my head
Call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fuckin' with my head

I was left all alone, all I could do was cry

Can't fuck with that ho, she got bodies
She ride too much dick, that girl got too much mileage
We be thuggin' and clutchin', we up and bust it, I swear I'm surrounded by shottas

Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up

Feel like the least of all your problems
You can reach me if you wanna stay up tonight, stay up at night
Green lights in your body language
Seems like you could use a little company from me
But if you got everything figured out like you say
Don't waste a minute, don't wait a minute
It's only a matter of time for you-ooh-ooh-ooh to-ooh-ooh-ooh
Tell me now, 'cause I've been up for, I've been up for

Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up (Ooh)

I can't fix each and all your problems
I'm no good with names and faces
She sent me naked pictures from her neck down to the waist
I get my feelings involved, she stopped returnin' my calls
Her flaws turned into walls and barricades
And I'm too far gone in all the wrong ways
And now every long day is a bad one
I can't make you call or make you stay or take you off the pedestal
So I get lost in modern music, watchin' movies, talkin' to the walls in my room
Walkin' through the halls in my head, just tryna make sure it all makes sense
I ain't made of money, maybe someday, you can take it from me?
I'm up too late thinkin' 'bout you and M.I.A. for

44,7 rings,Ariana Grande,"7 rings Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)
[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, ""Which one?"" I say, ""Nah, I want all of 'em""
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')

I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)

Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, ""Put it in the bag,"" yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

4,A Cover Is Not the Book,Emily Blunt,"A Cover Is Not the Book Lyrics[MARY POPPINS]
Uncle Gutenberg was a bookworm
And he lived on Charing Cross
The memory of his volumes brings a smile
He would read me lots of stories
When he wasn't on the sauce
Now I'd like to share the wisdom
Of my favourite bibliophile
He said a-

Cover is not the book
So open it up and take a look
'Cause under the covers one discovers
That the king may be a crook
Chapter titles are like signs
And if you read between the lines
You'll find your first impression was mistook
For a cover is nice
But a cover is not the book

Mary Poppins, could you give us an example?
[MARY POPPINS]
Certainly!

Nellie Rubina was made of wood
But what could not be seen was though
Her trunk up top was barren
Well, her roots were lush and green
So in Spring when Mr Hickory saw her blossoms blooming there
He took root despite her bark
And now there's seedlings everywhere

[MARY POPPINS and JACK]
Which proves
A cover is not the book
So open it up and take a look
'Cause under the covers one discovers
That the king may be a crook
Chapter titles are like signs
And if you read between the lines
You'll find your first impression was mistook
For a cover is nice
But a cover is not the book

[JACK]
Should we do the one about the wealthy widow?
[MARY POPPINS]
Oh, by all means!

[JACK]
Always loved that one

[MARY POPPINS]
Well, go on then!

[JACK]
Lady Hyacinth Macaw
Brought all her treasures to a reef

[MARY POPPINS]
Where she only wore a smile

Plus two feathers, and a leaf

[MARY POPPINS]
So no one tried to rob her
'Cause she barely wore a stitch

For when you're in your birthday suit
[MARY POPPINS and JACK]
There ain't much there to show you're rich!

Oh, a cover is not the book

You'll find your first impression was mistook (Ya-da-da-da)

[MARY POPPINS]
Oh, give us the one about the dirty rascal, why don't ya?

[JACK]
Isn't that one a bit long?

[MARY POPPINS]
Well, the quicker you're into it, the quicker you're out of it.

[JACK]
Once upon a time
In a nursery rhyme
There was a castle with a king
Hiding in a wing
'Cause he never went to school to learn a single thing

He had scepters and swords
And a parliament of lords
But on the inside he was sad
Egad!
Because he never had a wisdom for numbers
A wisdom for words
Though his crown was quite immense
His brain was smaller than a bird's
So the queen of the nation
Made a royal proclamation:
""To the Missus and the Messers
The more or lessers
Bring me all the land's professors""
Then she went to the hair dressers

And they came from the east
And they came from the south
From each college they poured knowledge
From their brains into his mouth
But the king couldn't learn
So each professor met their fate
For the queen had their heads removed
And placed upon the gate
And on that date
I state their wives all got a note
Their mate was now the late-great

But then suddenly one day
A stranger started in to sing
He said, ""I'm the dirty rascal
And I'm here to teach the king""
And the queen clutched her jewels
For she hated royal fools
But this fool had some rules
They really ought to teach in schools

Like you'll be a happy king
If you enjoy the things you've got
You should never try to be
The kind of person that you're not
So they sang and they laughed
For the king had found a friend
And they ran onto a rainbow for
The story's perfect end

So the moral is you musn't let
The outside be the guide
For it's not so cut and dried
Well unless it's Dr. Jekyll
Then you better hide, petrified!
No, the truth can't be denied
As I now have testified
All that really counts and matters
Is the special stuff inside

[AUDIENCE]
He did it!

[ALL]
Oh, a cover is not the book
So open it up and take a look
'Cause under the covers one discovers

[MARY POPPINS]
So please listen to what we've said

[JACK]
And open up a book tonight in bed

[MARY POPPINS and JACK]
So one more time before we get the hook

Sing it out strong!

Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga
[Chorus: 21 Savage]
How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)

26,A Nightmare on My Street,DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince,"A Nightmare on My Street Lyrics[Intro: Fresh Prince]
Now I have a story that I'd like to tell
About this guy you all know him, he had me scared as hell!
He comes to me at night after I crawl into bed
He's burnt up like a weenie and his name is Fred!
He wears the same hat and sweater every single day
And even if it's hot outside he wears it anyway!
He's gone when I'm awake but he shows up when I'm sleep
I can't believe that there's a nightmare on my street!

[Verse 1: Fresh Prince]
It was a Saturday evening, if I remember it right
And we had just gotten back off tour last night
So the gang and I thought that it would be groovy
If we summoned up the posse and bum rushed the movies
I got Angie, Jeff got Tina
Ready Rock got some girl I'd never seen in my life
That was all right though 'cause the lady was chill
Then we dipped to the theater set to ill
Buggin', cold havin' a ball
And somethin' ‘bout Elm Street was the movie we saw
The way it started was decent, you know nothing real fancy
About this homeboy named Freddy and this girl named Nancy
But word when it was over I said, “Yo, that was def!”
And everything seemed alright when we left
But when I got home and laid down to sleep
That began the nightmare, but on my street!
[Verse 2: Fresh Prince & Freddy Kruger]
It was burning in my room like an oven
My bed soaked with sweat, man, I was buggin'
I checked the clock and it stopped at 12:30
It had melted, it was so darn hot, and I was thirsty
I went downstairs to grab some juice or a Coke
Flipped the TV off, and then I almost choked
When I heard this awful voice comin' from behind
It said, ""You turned off David Letterman, now you must die!""
Man, I ain't even wait to see who it was
Broke outside in my drawers and screamed, ""So long, cuz!""
Got halfway up the block I calmed down and stopped screamin'
Then thought, ""Oh, I get it, I must be dreamin""
I strolled back home with a grin on my grill
I figured since this is a dream I might as well get ill
I walked in the house, the Big Bad Fresh Prince
But Freddy killed all that noise real quick
He grabbed me by my neck and said
""Here's what we'll do, we got a lot of work here, me and you
The souls of your friends you and I will claim
You've got the body, and I've got the brain""
I said, ""Yo Fred, I think you've got me all wrong
I ain't partners with nobody with nails that long!
Look, I'll be honest, man, this team won't work
The girls won't be on you, Fred your face is all burnt!""
I pat him on the shoulder said, ""Thanks for stopping by.""
Then I opened up the door and said, ""Take care guy!""
He got mad, drew back his arm, and slashed my shirt
I laughed at first, then thought, ""Hold up, that hurt!""
It wasn't a dream, man, this guy was for real
I said, ""Freddy, uh, pal, there's been an awful mistake here.""
No further words and then I darted upstairs
Crashed through my door then jumped on my bed
Pulled the covers up over my head
And said, ""Oh please do somethin' with Fred!""
He jumped on my bed, ripped through the covers with his claws
Tried to get me, but my alarm went off
And then silence! It was a whole new day
I thought, ""Huh, I wasn't scared of him anyway.""
Until I noticed those rips in my sheets
And that was proof that there had been a nightmare, on my street
[Outro: Fresh Prince, Jazzy Jeff & Freddy Krueger]
Oh man, I gotta call Jeff, I gotta call Jeff
Come on, come on
Come on Jeff, answer
Come on, man
Hello?
Jeff, this is Prince, man
Jeff, wake up
Jeff, wake up
What do you want?
Jeff, wake up, man
Listen to me, Jeff
It's three o'clock in the mornin', what do you want?
Jeff, Jeff, would you listen to me?
Listen, whatever you do, don't fall asleep
Man!

Look, look, I'll talk to you tomorrow, I'm going to bed

I'm a shark in the ocean if she give me the bait
Drip, drip, wet, wet, wet all on the floor (Floor)
Busta Rhymes with the high, I told her, ""Gimme some more"" (Let's go)
Waterfall with the splash, bungee jump from a flight (Woo)
That shit was oh so right, I had to dive in twice (Two times)
Ain't no safety belt (Nah)
Ain't no jacket for the livin', ain't no safety here (Nah)
She was bustin' out the pipes from all the pressure in it
It'll never be the same if I ever hit it (Stretch)
Olympic gold, I'm a better swimmer
Yo, hittin' stroke at different angles
Damn, so much of the wet she had to change clothes
Woah, all of this water, what you drank for?

She asked me why is my drink so pink

And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
And I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you

Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?

But shouldn't that be enough for me?

Drivin' through the road work, oh, the work they took forever on
The road cones blur like mem'ries of the miles we shared between
The place you learned to say your prayers, the place I took to prayin'
Loadin' in and breakin' down my road dog door deal dreams
Long before we ever met, I made up my direction
Long before I knew the half of half I'm sure of now
Though I'd say it ain't the way that you'd have gone about it
You follow me and lead me on and never let me down

So I'll love you 'til my lungs give out, I ain't lyin'

29,Almost,Hozier,"Almost (Sweet Music) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I came in from the outside, burned out from a joy ride
She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway
Played from the bedside is ""Stella by Starlight""
That was my heart, the drums that start off ""Night and Day""

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The same kind of music haunts her bedroom
I'm almost me again, she's almost you

[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

[Verse 2]
Tell me who, and I'll be thanking them
The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington
Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek as soft as Chet can sing
Let's get lost and let the good times roll
Let smoke rings from this paper doll
Blow sweet and thick 'til every thought of it don't mean a thing
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I got some colour back, she thinks so, too
I laugh like me again, she laughs like you

[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

[Verse 3]
The very thought of you and am I blue?
A love supreme seems far removed
I get along without you very well some other nights
Oh, the radio news reader chimes
Reporting Russian lullabies
She'll turn to me awake and ask, ""Is everything alright?""
And, Lord

I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start

Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start

A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

[Pre-Chorus]
I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

[Verse 2]
How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

Loving you is a losing game

[Intro: Yandel & Wisin]
¡Wisin y Yandel!
De regreso con el King

[Verso 1: Romeo Santos, Wisin & Yandel]
Encontré un cabello tuyo en mi cama
Me quedé pensando dónde estás ahora
Te esperaba hace un par de horas
(Casi siempre todo sale a la luz; De horas)
Tengo el presentimiento de que no andas sola
No me has escrito ni siquiera un ""Hola""
Tú sigues envolviéndome

[Pre-Coro: Yandel]
Con la misma historia
Cuando te veo se me olvida todo
No quiero hablar, prefiero hacerme el loco
Quitándote la ropa poco a poco

[Coro: Romeo Santos & Yandel]
Aullando como loba (Auh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
¿Así quién no te perdona?
Si mi cama te añora?
Cualquiera se enamora (Auh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
Si pasa una noche contigo
Y le haces lo que haces conmigo (¡Yandel!)
[Verso 2: Yandel]
Explícame, si estás conmigo y estás con él (Él)
Así me busco otra yo también (Oh, oh, uh-uh-uh)
Y simplemente la pasamos bien, decídete
Porque yo sé, que a ti te gusta cómo lo hago yo (Eh-eh, eh)
¿A quién engaña'?, no diga' que no (Eh-eh)
Por algo siempre acabamo' los do' comiéndono', baby

[Puente: Romeo Santos]
Qué suerte que tengo mala memoria
Sólo me acuerdo de la gloria
De cuando hacemos el amor

[Pre-Coro: Yandel & Wisin]
Con la misma historia
Cuando te veo se me olvida todo
No quiero hablar, prefiero hacerme el loco
Quitándote la ropa poco a poco (Yeah!)

[Coro: Romeo Santos, Yandel & Wisin]
Aullando como loba (Auh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
¿Así quién no te perdona?
Si mi cama te añora
Cualquiera se enamora (Auh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
Si pasa una noche contigo
Y le haces lo que haces conmigo
(Baby, a mí tú no me coges más de pendejo; ¡W!)
[Verso 3: Wisin]
Beba, te esperaba, y tú revolcándote en otra cama
Sabiendo que con él no sientes nada-nada
Yo soy el que te lleva a las nubes (Yeah), el que te sube (Yeah)
El que con besos te calienta y rápido tú fluyes (¡Pre-Prende!)
Yo soy el hombre que te pega a la pared (Pah, pah, tra)
El que te quita el estrés
Tú tiemblas cuando me ves (¿Qué?)
Es que ya yo sé lo que pasa, ¿por qué te disfrazas?
Cuéntale a ese bobo cómo te lo hice en la terraza
Y le revelo (¡Duro!), le puse en los ojos un pañuelo (Tra, tra, tra)
Tenía ropa interior de terciopelo (¡Duro!)
Todavía en mis sábanas encuentro tu cabello
Yo sé que tú no superas cuando te muerdo el cuello (""El King"")

[Verso 4: Romeo Santos, Yandel & Wisin]
Si él supiera que tú nos divide' en el calendario
Loba sin dueño no tiene horario
Tú te has convertido en un mal necesario
Y él se come tu cuento
Lo que tú le digas como un niño te lo cree (Ajá)
Y yo disfruto de tu piel, viviéndome el momento

I thought I had it all together
But I was led astray
The day you walked away
You were the clock that was ticking in my home
Changed my state of mind
But love's so hard to find
Your feelings changed like the weather
Went from clear to grey
On that cloudy day
How can I go on without falling apart?
Love's so hard to find
When someone's on your mind

[Chorus]
Listen, baby
Your wish is my command
Baby, won't you understand
That your wish is my command?
What can I do to make my baby understand?

[Verse 2]
Something tells me that I'm dreaming
I can see us there
Waving unaware
Of problems that have a tendency to keep
Keep the truth confined
Far from our minds
You need someone you can believe in
This I do declare
Trust me I'll be there
The road that leads to heaven can be so steep
I will help you climb
Change your state of mind

Listen baby

Baby, won't you understand
That your wish is my command?
What can I do to make my baby understand?

So I hopped into a car, headed straight to the bar
Poured me out little Hank (huh)
Pulled up some party buses
Girls on top like it's nothin'
Dancin' like no one's in sight
With just one girl in white

They all hopped off of the bus
Two step to the club, yeehaw, giddyup

Travel from far and wide
To have a good ass time (a good time)

24,Bad Bad Bad,Young Thug,"Bad Bad Bad Lyrics[Intro]
Wheezy outta here

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Rose gold seats on a fuckin' helicopter
Double C, no Chanel, 'cause she bad, bad, bad
Ridin' Kawasaki, and I could cop you a new 'Rari
Let you ride it, know your route and you're bad, bad, bad
No playin', no Atari, I won't play with you for nothin'
I can eat you like Hibachi 'cause you bad, bad, bad
I just took the doors off the 'Ghini, now I'm ridin'
And I'm slidin' in her sideways, now she call me her zaddy

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Rich nigga shit, I bought my thottie a new Patek
Got a model, got a thickie, got a BM, got a stallion
Got a billion dollar corporation, fuck a Xanny
I got millions to go get and a couple bitches to–uh, yeah
You my dawg 'til we dead, not a question
But I can't fuck with you like I want 'cause you ratted
Got a million dollars in the wall, in the band'
And got it stepped-on, got it hard, got it crackin' on her
Half a million, I just did a warm up for half a million, uh, uh, mmm
I can buy the buildin'
I can rent this shit out or save it for the children
I can dead this shit out or give it to the villains
Somewhere they can hide when they do some killin'
All of the rides got grenade ceilings
Loaded with a ride, cost a cool million

And I'm slidin' in her sideways, now she call me her zaddy

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Paper tag, peanut butter seats, I'm ridin'

Different color Diors on my feet, I couldn't decide which
Never talked about it, she done made herself my side bitch
Trash bag gang, I can put that on Elijah
Street chose me, I ain't never had to sign up
Then we hittin' bitches in the group, I make 'em line up
Beep, beep, beep, that's me, nigga, get back
Real dopeboy, don't know how to work a CashApp
How many you got? I'll send it 'lone, bring the cash out
I been sippin' lean, 'bout to pee 'til I pass out
Went to sleep 'partment, woke up in the paradise
Niggas stealin' drip but it don't matter, they don't wear it right
They don't even speak but I can see I got 'em terrified

42,Bad Idea,Cordae,"Bad Idea Lyrics[Intro: YBN Cordae]
Ooh
Ooh
Yeah, uh
(Bongo ByTheWay)

[Verse 1: YBN Cordae]
I know myself all too well to be a stranger of pain
Despite it all, we remainin' the same, I'm just changin' the game
Heart pure, never tainted with fame
Straight ahead, I'ma stay in my lane
Never switchin' courses, life's amazin', shit is gorgeous
Lookin' at the bigger picture, portrait, and I smile wide
Performed the song and the crowd cried
How can I lie? I'm tearin' up as I'm startin' to stare in y'all eyes
I know the shit you goin' through the last month
You stressin' as you hittin' on that glass blunt
A nigga prayin' to get lucky like Daft Punk
You can't even stomach the pain, now that's a bad lunch
Uh, ramen noodles on the regular
Add some seasoning and some hot sauce for a better touch
Peanut butter, jelly and syrup sandwich, etcetera
And we just flyin' in the nebula

[Chorus: YBN Cordae]
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
See, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
So don't you cry, little baby, little baby
(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It'll be alright
So don't you cry, little baby, little baby
(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It's gon', it'll be alright
[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I done been around the world four times, lookin' for parkin'
Finally found a condo, that shit still feel like apartment
Out South, my foul mouth started soundin' like Cartman
Roundabout like cartwheels, hopped inside of a U-Haul
Confused where all my art went, monsters in a quiet place
Some of these decisions is like Sharpie on a dry-erase
I know they thought I wouldn't, but I'm a fireplace
I had my cake and ate it too, that shit is an acquired taste
I promised I would buy a place, I got my favorite roommates
They used to never see me, like when you zip up a new Bape
Do that shit 'fore it's too late, don't ever drink the Kool-Aid
Don't ever think it's sweet, that's that crème de la brûlée
Who they? They Robert Goulet, they Nazi, cuckoo, goofy
My wifey yellin', ""Who they?"" My daughter yellin', ""Hooray""
I see it clear like Blu-Ray, I park it in the sky
I keep 'em on my block, 'round the corner of my eye
Like a stye (Uh)

[Verse 3: YBN Cordae]
So don't you shed a tear
'Cause there'll be better years
I live life by faith, nigga, instead of fear
God cryin', thunderstorms is Heaven tears
The feelin' of lost hope, shit is never here
'Cause we gon' make it happen by any means
A young nigga, dawg, but I done witnessed many things
Age 13, wearin' hand-me-down skinny jeans
You know they a little extra faded around the knees
With the grass stains in 'em
I really wish a little extra cash came in 'em, 'cause a nigga really needed it
Pain, I defeated it, and brought back
Soul survivor, nigga, what you call that?
[Chorus: YBN Cordae]
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
See, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
So don't you cry, little baby, little baby
(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It'll be alright
So don't you cry, little baby
(Don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It's gon', it's gon' be alright
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
See, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
So don't you cry, little baby
It'll be alright
So don't you cry, little baby
It'll be alright18Embed","bet , bet , af  , lit  , lit  , lit  , lit  , lit  , lit  , lit  , lit  , lit  , lit  , lit  , extra  , extra  , tea  , tea  , tea  , tea  , "

I put the new Forgis on the Jeep
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath
'Cause all my niggas got it out the streets
I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans
I remember hittin' the mall with the whole team
Now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'
I was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty

All this designer on my body got me drip, drip, ayy
Straight up out the Yajects, I'm a big Crip
If I got a pint of lean, I'ma sip, sip
I run the racks up with my queen like London and Nip
But I got rich on all these niggas, I didn't forget, back
I had to go through the struggle, I didn't forget that
I hopped inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These bitches know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that
Young nigga on the corner, bitch, I had to serve crack
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath
Cut off the brain and I give my bitch a new coupe
Either you from the Yah Gang or you're SuWoop
Got a New Orleans bitch and man, that pussy voodoo
And I'm that nigga now, who knew?

Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that ""come get me"" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Verse 2]
She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says, ""Let's stay on the couch and watch TV""
And she falls asleep

Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah, I'm such a fool for her

And wears her heart on her sleeve

Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all

Como en la playa cuando se te mete entre las nalgas arena
Un baile con cosas obscenas
Que cuando nos mire la gente, les dé vergüenza ajena
Hasta abajo sin pena
Que se nos olvide que no hemos cobra'o la quincena
Química de la buena, conectado' como las hormiga', pero sin antenas
Mueve ese culei de bomba y plena
Cortaron a Elena, pero nadie nos frena
No somos de Hollywood, pero dominamos la escena
Hasta de espalda la goleamos, una chilena
Hoy nadie nos ordena, sólo este general cuando suena
(Buena, tú te ves bien buena)
Mueve esa vajilla
Como entrando por la puerta de un iglú; doblando rodillas
Como una culebrilla con piernas; resbala zapatillas
Como que el piso esta embarra'o con mantequilla
Azúcar por la vena con jeringuilla
Lo que traigo es chocolate con vainilla
Con mi música tú brillas
En este mundo somos tú y yo y después van las siete maravillas
Pa' los que están senta'os, llegó la pesadilla
Con medio pocillo pongo a perrear hasta a las silla'
Con este dembow les quito el hambre
Se habían olvida'o de que tengo a White Lion en la sangre

32,Better Together,Luke Combs,"Better Together Lyrics[Verse 1]
A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

[Verse 2]
Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
[Bridge]
Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest
Your first and my last name

[Chorus]
Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer

Just look at her sittin' there
Sweatpants, t-shirt, in her comfy chair, hmm
Her hair in a bun, one hand on a mug
And the other one’s playin' snare
To a George Strait vinyl, that yes-or-no line will get her close
But I don't think she can understand
Just how far I’ve been lettin' my heart fall
But what's in my head

[Chorus]
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Build a little house out on some hand-me-down land
Find a little island where we go to get tan
I bet we take our kids down there one day
And I know she wouldn't mind if I
Did a little somethin' like find a flight
Overnight to paradise and leave tonight
And I'ma put a diamond on her hand

[Post-Chorus]
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don’t know, well, she don’t know
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don’t know, well, she don't know
[Verse 2]
Well, she don't know I already bought a ring
Hid it in the bottom left drawer, right beside the sink
A shiny emerald diamond on a brand-new band
Asked her mama for permission and her daddy for her hand

[Chorus]
I got some big, big plans
Build a little house out on some hand-me-down land
Find a little island where we go to get tan
I bet we take our kids down there one day
And I know she wouldn't mind if I
Did a little somethin’ like find a flight

Well, here I go
'Cause right now, we're back in her hometown
And I'm down on one knee
I guess she finally figured out
I'm gonna ask her to marry me

Ones that hate us, handcuff us and mace us
Call us dumb niggas 'cause our culture is contagious

That lived long enough to see it changin'
Think it's time we make arrangements
Finally wiggle out they mazes
Find me out in different places

Pretend it doesn't bother me
I'm not very strong but
I'll fuck you up if you're mean to bugs

It's getting cold down here underneath the weather
I skipped class to sit with you
I really like your spotty sweater
If ladybugs are girls
How do you make kids together?
What's it like in a female world?
I bet it's just so much better

And I couldn't give a shit

They have always listened to me

The other boys at school
Think it's cool to hate your parents
But they’re lying all the time

And if you wanna cry
Make sure that they never see it
Or even better yet
Block it out and never feel it

Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart

Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)

Pyrex, turn me up

I just bought the bitch a new big face brand new Patek (Ice)
Now she gon' forever call me daddy

I just bought the bitch a new penthouse hundred floors up
With the bustdown Rollie with a necklace to match
Now she gon' forever call me daddy
Now she gon' forever call me daddy
Slide in that pussy like DM's
Pussy so good, get goosebumps

Give her death-row dick, no 2Pac

She gon' forever call me daddy
She gon' forever call me daddy

[Verse 1: PopLord]
Bad bitch, she bustin', never jammin'
That pussy fully automatic

Beat the guts, she be oozing when I stab her
Dick gon' hit like an Uzi when I have her
Eat the dick but I love when she lick it
Eat the pussy while I grip on her titties
Woo, punish her like a suspension
She gave my dick head detention
Gave her a Perky, she with it (Drugs)

She ready, she horny, she with it
Fuckin' a boss and she know
She ready, she litty, she wetty

Don’t call me daddy unless you got it tatted
We can keep fucking for hours, I'm an addict
If I'm on your back, I'm never tryna scratch it
They say they want action, fuck it, we gon' smash 'em
The penthouse so plush, I'm living like a bachelor
I ain't fuckin' with her now, she tryna bash me
I want fifty a verse, or nigga, don't even ask me
And fifteen a piece for them things that's in plastic
The media all in my business, harassing me
If I want your shit, then it's up, we gon' jack you
Probably be one of the realest lil' rappers
Still spending legal like I'm somewhere trapping
She call me zaddy whenever we fuck
Whenever I call, she know to pick up
Hit her, no rubber, she say she in love
I come from the jungle, she know I'm a thug

Pacing around, watching my feet
Batteries drain, I get the memo

24,Can You Imagine That,Emily Blunt,"Can You Imagine That? Lyrics[MARY POPPINS]
John, you're right
It's good to know you're bright
For intellect can wash away confusion
Georgie sees
And Annabel agrees
Most folderol's an optical illusion
You three know it's true
That one plus one is two
Yes, logic is the rock of our foundation
I suspect, and I'm never incorrect
That you're far too old to give into imagination

No, not yet!

Some people like to splash and play
Can you imagine that?
And take a seaside holiday
Can you imagine that?
Too much glee leaves rings around the brain
Take that joy and send it down the drain

Some people like to laugh at life
And giggle through the day
They think the world's a brand new shiny toy
And if while dreaming in the clouds
They fall and go kersplat
Although they're down and bent in half
They brush right off and start to laugh
Can you imagine that?
On second thoughts, perhaps you're right. It makes no sense to take a bath this early

[GEORGIE]
Wait. I want to take a bath!

[MARY POPPINS]
Oh, really? Up you go and in you go!

Can you imagine that?
And flap about in bathtub gin
Can you imagine that?
Doggies paddling twenty leagues below
Might seem real but we know
It's not so
To cook without a recipe
Can you imagine that?
And heaven knows what lives within that pot
Some pirates follow treasure maps
And wear a silly hat
They search the world for buried gold
They won't grow up and don't grow old
Can you imagine that?

Be sure to scrub behind your ears!

Yeah, I'm bringing her home, she giving me dome
After she done, I'm blocking her phone
She sayin' I'm wrong, ho, leave me alone
Know I'm a dog, I just want a bone
Pull up on you, what it do with it
Bullets stick to your skin, like glue in it
Shots went to your house, nigga, who did it?
Straight bangin' the C ooh-woo with it

In a party deuce, deuce and the shoe with it
Shots through your brain, through your fitted

There was a time that I swore I would never go back
I was blind to the truth, didn't know what I had
I was running, I was searching
But every place I turned for healing
Left me more broken than the last

[Chorus]
Take me back
To the place that feels like home
To the people I can depend on
To the faith that's in my bones
Take me back
To a preacher and a verse
Where they've seen me at my worst
To the love I had at first
Oh, I want to go to church

[Verse 2]
Tried to walk on my own but I wound up lost
Now I'm making my way to the foot of the cross
It's not a trophy for the winners
It's a shelter for the sinners
And it's right where I belong

[Chorus]
Take me back
To the place that feels like home
To the people I can depend on
To the faith that's in my bones
Take me back

Where they've seen me at my worst
To the love I had at first
Oh, I want to go to church

Come along, catch a Heffalump
Sit with me on a muddy clump
We'll sing a song of days gone by
Run along now, don’t be glum
Get you gone, now, have some fun
Don't be long, for the end is nigh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't let moments pass along
And waste before your eyes
March with me and the borogoves
Come with me and the slithy toves
And never ask us why

[Chorus]
Come, come, come, come, come along now
Run away from the hum-drum
We'll go to a place that is safe from
Greed, anger and boredom
We'll dance and sing till sundown
And feast with abandon
We'll sleep when the morning comes
And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs

[Bridge]
We'll be here when the world slows down
And the sunbeams fade away
Keeping time by a pendulum
As the fabric starts to fray
There’s no such thing as time to kill
Nor time to throw away
So, once for the bright sky, twice for the pig sty
Thrice for another day
[Chorus]
Come, come, come, come, come along now
Run away from the hum-drum
We'll go to a place that is safe from
Greed, anger and boredom
We'll dance and sing till sundown
And feast with abandon
We'll sleep when the morning comes
And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs

[Verse 2]
Come with me, catch a rare type specimen
Cuddle up with a hesitant skeleton
We'll break our fast with friends
Once we're fed, we shall disappear rapidly
Many moons to the west of here and happily
Our journey never ends

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Shut your ears when sirens sing,
Tie armbands to your feet
Listen up and you won't go wrong again
Float along on a verse-less song and then
Get to where the two ends meet

[Chorus]
Come, come, come, come, come along now
Run away from the hum-drum
We'll go to a place that is safe from
Greed, anger and boredom
We'll dance and sing till sundown
And feast with abandon
We'll sleep when the morning comes
And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs12Embed","af  , af  , af  , lit  , "

Guess to beat one Swedish boy, you need a billion Asians
Yeah, you did it, very nice, and all it took
Was a massive corporate entity with every song in Bollywood
Now you're at number one (One), hope you did nothing wrong
Like starting your business by selling pirated songs
Oops! Didn't think we'd see? It's right there on Wikipedia
Get used to your past being held against you by the media (Uh oh)

I'm certain that you haven't had collusions with the mafia
For legal reasons, that's a joke

I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
I see the world through eyes covered in ink and bleach
Cross out the ones who heard my cries and watched me weep

[Chorus]
I love everything
Fire's spreading all around my room
My world’s so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush
Shh

[Verse 2]
Tape my eyes open to force reality (Oh no, no)
Why can’t you just let me eat my weight in glee?
I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
Some days I feel skinnier than all the other days
Sometimes I can't tell if my body belongs to me

[Chorus]
I love everything
Fire's spreading all around my room
My world's so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush

[Verse 3]
I wanna taste your content
Hold your breath and feel the tension
Devils hide behind redemption
Honesty is a one-way gate to hell
I wanna taste consumption
Breathe faster to waste oxygen
Hear the children sing aloud
It's music 'til the wick burns out
Hush

[Outro]
Just wanna be care free lately, yeah
Just kicking up daisies
Got one too many quarters in my pockets
Count ’em like the four-leaf clovers in my locket
Untied laces, yeah
Just tripping on daydreams
Got dirty little lullabies playing on repeat
Might as well just rot around the nursery and count sheep110Embed","af  , lit  , lit  , "

50,Creeker,Tyler Childers,"Creeker Lyrics[Verse 1]
In a small corner bar, he sits there a-drinkin'
Lost as a ball in a field full of corn
Further away than he ever imagined
That he'd ever end up from the place he was born
Now no more forlorn has a Creeker drank whiskey
Than the one that you see out the side of your eye
Drinkin' alone as he looks out the window
At all of the strangers on the corner outside

[Chorus]
And he'd rather be dead than alive one more minute
In this Godforsaken town
When he was a kid, Lord, he'd never a'dreamt it
All the ways that the city can bring a country boy down

[Verse 2]
Now they knew not his name and he knew not their faces
And he knew not the how nor the reason for why
You could ever wake up and wanna keep on a-livin'
In a place where a friend is such a hard thing to find
And for everyone you meet, there's a whole mess of people
Tryin' like hell to pull you on down
To the level they're on and the trouble they're tendin'
In the mess that they've made, in the gutter they found
[Chorus]
And he'd rather be dead than alive one more minute
In this Godforsaken town
When he was a kid, Lord, he'd never a'dreamt it
All the ways that the city can bring a country boy down

[Bridge]
Some fellas do drugs and things of that nature
Some fellas chase girls to hang on their arm
Some fellas get by on practically nothin'
Some fellas get pissed in a small corner bar

[Chorus]
And they'd rather be dead than alive one more minute
In this Godforsaken town
When they were all kids, Lord, they'd never a'dreamt it
All the ways that the city can bring a country boy downEmbed",

Watch this shit get knee high, boy, you live and you die by this game
Homeboy just caught HIV, he lived and he died by his ho
Have we ever hit the same bitch before? Ain't nobody know
Have we ever hit the same bitch before? Wasn't nobody business

Fly like the wind, it's time to begin your life

Made it through my whole month with my lights out, I seen brighter days
Watch this shit get knee high, boy, you live and you die by this game
Bitch, don't touch my body
'Cause I put your body all off in a body sling
You ain't gon' hurt nobody
Go body for body but we the body gang

Thought she was boostin' her credit
With niggas like you that just ain't got enough on their name
Thought I would front you another one
Niggas like you that just ain't got enough on the books
Talkin' that shit in the booth but when niggas come shoot at you
You couldn't do nothin' but look
My niggas done bust a four nickel on your nigga
Bust him, now he on a shit bag
His homie done borrowed a car and he got it shot up
Now I know that his bitch mad
He steadily called up my phone and you huffin' and puffin'
'Cause they at your bitch, duckin'
And Roc, he done went and bought Jeezy a pair of new shoes

Cross off the days gone
Cross off the days gone

Wasting away
A self-inflicted slow decay
What should've been, what never was
Became the end for both of us

[Pre-Chorus 1: Chester Bennington]
Heavy is the hand that points the finger (Finger)
Heavy is the heart that's filled with anger (Anger)
So lay them all to waste
Years you decided to erase
And cross off the days

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So black out and hide behind the lines
Keep staring down the sun and hope the
Light will finally blind your eyes from seeing
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone by
[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Cutting you free
The phantom limb was part of me
You have lived, you have lost
The separation's worth the cost

[Pre-Chorus 2: Chester Bennington]
Heavy are the words that go unspoken (Spoken)
Heavy are the promises now broken (Broken)
Will you learn to love the taste
Of the destruction in your wake?
Cross off the days

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So black out and hide behind the lines
Keep staring down the sun and hope the
Light will finally blind your eyes from seeing
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Gone by
Making my way back from the madness
Shifting my thoughts from the blackness
And the sadness, but the fact is
I'm swinging through life like a clenched fist
Fuck sanity, I wanna bleed
Can't kill the pain, it's everything
It's all I feel, it's what I breathe
Turn the hate I breed into what I need
Heavy is the hand that points the finger (Finger)
Heavy is the heart that's filled with anger (Anger)
[Pre-Chorus 3: Chester Bennington]
Did you survey everything you laid to waste
And cross off the days?

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So black out and hide behind the lines
Keep staring down the sun and hope the
Light will finally blind your eyes from seeing

Pipe that shit up, TnT
Tre made this beat

[Verse 1: Rod Wave]
Let’s talk 'bout hard times, real bottom boy survivor
Way before the jewelry, the groupie hoes, and designer
Back when I was tryna find a way for all my partners
Rema hit the window, popped the door for me and Lijah
'Member wakin’ up with no destination
But I had some dedication, couldn't use my education
'Cause no nine dollars could help me face what I was facing
My light bill due, envelope blue, that mean you behind on payments
Rap slowed down and I was low on cash
Fresh out of high school, kicked out the house for living fast
Went and got a spot, then got a job, 'cause pops was on my ass
Then that's when pops had went to jail so it didn't last
Hit the block with Brock 'cause I was tryna pay my bills
Like fuck a rap career, let's touch these streets and make a mil’
Fast forward, like Rod Wave, tell me how you feel
When I think about my past, that shit give me chills, uh

[Chorus: Rod Wave & Kevin Gates]
Wake up in the morning, hit my knees, and I pray
Because He finally made a way
I been runnin’ up that paper, mama
And before I let 'em come and take it, mama
I’ma die in these Cuban links
I'm gon' die in these Cuban links (Think it's a game)
Die in these Cuban links (Right now today, let’s go)
Die in these Cuban links (Yes, Lord)
[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
All my life it been a struggle
You on and fall off, you find out who really love you
Playin' in the storm drain, came out the gutter
Good relationships, I admit I had a couple
Making love to the money, me and bae a couple
Yola cooked down to the oil and it don't swish around
I need everything when it lock in the pot, yeah
Grab it off the top, let it dry, work the clock, yeah
Finally up in rank, movin' blocks, holdin' sham, yeah
Havin' my lil' way, ghetto pussy used to act funny
Now I'm hittin' her hard from the back, she throw it back for me
And when I went to jail, shawty left, turned her back on me
Flexin' on they ass, pants sag with them racks on 'em

[Chorus: Rod Wave]
Wake up in the morning, hit my knees, and I pray
Because He finally made a way
I been runnin' up that paper, mama
And before I let 'em come and take it, mama
I'ma die in these Cuban links
I'm gon' die in these Cuban links
Die in these Cuban links

36,Dear God,Dax,"Dear God Lyrics[Intro]
I just want to make this clear (Listen)
I am a believer
But sometimes it gets hard (Listen)
My name is Dax (Dear God)

[Verse 1]
Dear God
There’s a lot of questions that I have about the past (Can you hear me?)
And I don’t want hear it from a human you made it so you’re the last person that I’m ever gonna ask
Tell me what’s real, tell me what’s fake
Why is everything about you a debate? (Why?)
What’s the point of love?
Every time I’ve showed it I was broken and it’s forced me just to only wanna hate
Why’s there only one you but multiple religions? (Why?)
Why does every conversation end in a division? (Why?)
Why does everybody want to tell us how to live but they won’t listen to the same damn message that they giving? (Fuck them!)
Tell me how to feel, tell me what’s wrong
I tried to call, pick up the phone (Pick up!)
I’m on my own
Everybody says you’re coming back, then man why the hell's it taking so long?
Why do I hurt? (Why?)
Why is there pain?
Why does everything good always have to change? (Why!)
Why does everybody try to profit off another man's work then destroy it just for monetary gain?
Tell me are you black or are you white?
I don’t even really care I just really want to know what’s right (I don't care)
They been saying one thing but I’ve been looking in the book
And it seems like they’ve been lying for my whole damn life
Tell me where I’m going (Where?)
Is it heaven or hell?
I just hope this message greets you well
I had a dream that I was walking with the devil
Don’t remember how it feels but I swear that I remember the smell
Looked me right into my eyes and told me everything I wanted could be mine if I gave up and decided to sell
But I said I’d rather die then get mine now I’m here no fear one man with a story to tell
[Verse 2]
Dear God
Where were you when I needed it?
When I fucked up and repeated it?
When they set the bar and I exceeded it? (Where were you??)
My life is like a book that they’ve been judging by a cover but have never took the time to fucking read the shit (Fuck!)
I remember telling you my goals and my dreams but you didn’t even answer so I guess you didn’t believe in it
I remember sitting with a gun to my head trying to ask you for some help but I guess you didn’t believe in it!
I don’t want religion I need that spirituality
I don’t want a church I need people to call a family
I don’t wanna tell my sins to another sinner just because he’s got a robe and he went to some academy
I don't wanna read it in a book, I wanna hear it from you
Don’t wanna learn it in my school because they’re hiding the truth (Swear..)
Don’t wanna talk about it to another fucking human being and that's only reason that I even stepped in this booth

[Verse 3]
Dear God
How do I take this darkness and turn it into light? (Talk to me)
How do believe in a concept where I speak to a man I’ve never seen with my own two eyes? (How?)
How do I know that religion wasn’t made just to separate the world and create a whole disguise just to keep us in these chains while the rich get richer and the poor pray to you and perpetuate a lie?
How do I know this ain't some big joke? (How?)
How can I have faith when there is no hope?
How the hell does one man have 100 billion dollars and we still have people on the street that are broke?
There's a lot of things I wanna talk about and get off my chest
I can’t sleep 'cause the devil won’t let me rest
I used to know a fucking pastor in a church and I can still hear the screams of the kids he would fucking molest
[Verse 4]
Dear God
Do you hear me? (Do you hear me??)
I’m supposed to fear you but you ain’t said shit so maybe it's you who actually fears me?
I don’t know the answer I just want to see it clearly
So many lies there’s a 1000 different theories
All I want to know is who really made religion because I know it wasn’t you but don’t nobody believes me
No more lies, no more death
Bring back King, bring back X
Please dear God let their souls rest
Protect who’s left and watch their steps
Dear God (Dear god)
I don’t want to have to ask you again
I just hope that you know that I’m still a believer so I’ll end this all by saying amen

Look, my nigga this is dedication, this is anti-hesitation
This a real nigga celebration
This a Dime Blocc declaration
59th and 5th Ave, granny house with vanilla wafers
This the remedy, the separation
2Pac of my generation, blue pill in the fuckin' Matrix
Red rose in the gray pavement
Young black nigga trapped and he can't change it
Know he a genius, he just can't claim it
'Cause they left him no platforms to explain it
He frustrated so he get faded
But deep down inside he know you can't fade him
How long should I stay dedicated?
How long 'til opportunity meet preparation?
I need some real nigga reparations
'Fore I run up in your bank just for recreation

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]
Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin'
Dedication
It's dedication, look
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I spent my whole life thinkin' out the box
Boxin' homies three-on-one, got DP'ed but I ain't drop
Chirp on me, here I come, brrt, spin around the block
They blurped on me, said I ran a stop sign but that's a lie
I spent my whole life starin' at the stage
Playin' Sega, daddy smokin' sherm, mama playin' spades
Catchin' vapors, grandma said I'd get some Jordans for my grades
That's my baby, when she died my heart broke a hundred ways
I spent my whole life tryna make it, tryna chase it
The cycle of a black man divided, tryna break it
You take a loss? Shit, don't cry about it, just embrace it
Minor setback for major comeback, that's my favorite
My nigga L said, ""You do a song with Nip, K. Dot, he a better Crip""
I said, ""He a man first, you hear the words out his lips
About flourishing from the streets to black businesses?""
Level four, yard livin', given to false imprisonment
Listen close, my nigga
It's bigger than deuces and fours, my nigga
Since elementary we close, my nigga, yeah, straight like that
I give you the game, go back to the turf and give it right back
For generations we been dealt bad hands with bad plans
Prove your dedication by hoppin' out Grand Am's
I'm at the premiere politickin' with Top, Nip, and Snoop
Damn, Pac watchin' the way we grew, from dedication
[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
If it ain't congratulate then it look like hate
If it ain't congratulate then it look like what, Nipsey?
Hol' up

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Look
This ain't entertainment, it's for niggas on the slave ship
These songs just the spirituals I swam against them waves with
Ended up on shore to they amazement
Now I hope the example I set's not contagious
Lock us behind gates but can't tame us
Used to be, ""Stay safe,"" now it's, ""Stay dangerous""
'Cause ain't no point in playin' defense, nigga
That's why I dove off the deep end, nigga, without a life jacket
Couple mil', tour the world, dawg, my life crackin'
Cook the books, bring it back so it's no taxes
Royalties, publishing, plus I own masters
I'll be damned if I slave for some white crackers
I was mappin' this out, I hit the heist backwards
Hoppin' out the eighty-five in Reebok Classics
Ran a couple marathons just to get established
To make it happen, you got to have it

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle]

The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'

Oye, oye, óyeme bien
Tú eres lo que busco yo en una mujer

Ay, yo sé que es mentira
Decir que soy el hombre de tu vida
Si tú ayer no me conocías
Y no sabías que me querías

Y ver el amanecer contigo, contigo

The Hybrid, I'm telling you, try again
Sleep with the beast, Daniel in the lion's den
Still drop dirty, have to pop a Niacin
Itched all damn day, just to get violated
Ever seen a roach with babies have babies?
In the hood like whatever, we in this bitch together
Once got a ho, ain't had money for the room
So we did the humpty hump in a Burger King bathroom
Lowkey kept it undercover
The way she slurp slurp, she's the quicker picker upper
No job, dropped out and a felon
On the net, met a fat white bitch named Helen
300 pounds, maybe more like 280
Had a couple babies, 270 give or take it
Call that securin' the bag, had to fight the baby dad
Try to stop how I eat so I got up on his ass

[Verse 2]
What's in the dark, always come to light
Head was nasty, you'd think she had head lice
Why try? Throw bleach in your eye
Put your life on the line, hang 'em out to dry
Tryna keep my hands clean, out here ridin' dirty
Shit get messy? Mop him up with the .30
High Tide, Gain off the Arm and Hammer
Swim towards the current, system try to drown me
Stain your record like Clorox 'n' darks
Spin cycle had four tops for one
Out the slums, nobody gave me nothin'
Had temptations, so I hustled, David Ruffin
Papa was a rolling stone, so I sold rocks to 'em
Beam up Scotty, we got lift-off Houston
Left my sack in my clothes, Mama just did a load
Eight ball in my jeans, fiends say it taste like soap
[Verse 3]
Twenty five a peep show when I enter the booth
Mop the floor when I leave, might slip if you do
Cover your ears of your kids, we got round two
Fuck a bitch two times, call it deja vu
Fuck a stripper for some change, actual change
Dime, penny, nickels, actual change
Okay, wanna hear the story? Left the house in a hurry
I was at Hunky Dory's, got some dances from Lori
Left my wallet at home, ain't wanna hear that story
In the car had change from laundry
Had to wash clothes anyway, told her, ""I'm sorry""
Slow anyway, before you was boring
Said, ""Gimme a moment"", jumped on it and bounced
No fabric softener, 'cause I was hard
Then she gave me head, had me moaning and groaning
Guess who I seen doing laundry next morning?14Embed","low key  , "

No flask can keep it
Bubble up and cut right through
But you're someone I believe in
You heat me like a filament
Anytime you're in the room
But you burned me and I'm smoking

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to watch me dissolve, slowly
In a pool full of your love
But I don't even know how the chemistry works
When you're poolside
Kicking in the dirt, kicking in the sand
And stirring up trouble

[Verse 2]
Can't find an exit
I wander in a maze alone
If I find you will you shock me?
Left, left and right, right
Pretty sure that I've been here before
And it isn't what I wanted

I just wanted you to watch me dissolve, slowly
In a pool full of your love
But I don't even know how the chemistry works
When you're poolside
Kicking in the dirt, kicking in the sand
And stirring up trouble

Your voice like an angel
Been chainsmoking all month long
Like you're someone I believe in
Am I only a lab rat?
Someone you can test things on?
This isn't what I signed up for
I just wanted you to
I just wanted (Wanted)
I just wanted you to
I just wanted (Wanted)

And you see me from the street but I don't turn around
Would you say, ""Hi""? Would you keep going?
If I told your family that you didn't mean nothing
If you posted about it and I didn't even comment
If the songs weren't true, but you still feel something
Would you still come looking for me?

Might run across your mind but don't worry 'bout me, no
My heart is back in one piece, it ain't skipped a beat, no
Feeling rested up, I ain't missing sleep, no-oh
Don't take it personal if I can't reply now
I'm distant 'cause I don't wanna be reached now
Won't let the ghosts of our past weigh my future down
I'm liberated
Energy's like a circle, it comes back around
Reciprocated
Don't shed no more tears
Won't gain no empathy from me

Ain't call you back 'cause I let it go
I had to focus energy and just let it flow
And when we ride low, we were already gone
It wouldn't mean anymore to me now

That I finally moved on, and you thought it wouldn't happen
At times I used to cry when the world was laughing
But I act like I didn't notice

How did I live in a kingdom of thieves

You're only everything I ever dreamed
Ever dreamed of, ever dreamed of
You must be kidding me
Did you really think I could say no?

They found your wallet in the cemetery
You told your daughter she was ordinary

Your husband loved his computers
Your mother never was one
The eldest of seven children

You couldn't sober up to hold a baby

Tookie Williams over Coltrane
Eric B by the rope chain
RSC, we for sure bang
Tiny Locs and they go crazy
What you know about the dope game?
Was you born in the '80s? Did your mama smoke cocaine?
Have you ever seen a whole thang?
But you drove to the streets 'cause you grew up on short change?
Fucked up when the dope age
It remind me when these rappers drop duds and they quotes change
Had the part with the low fade
I would stand in front of Nix with my sack for the whole day
Drive-bys, that was road rage
Then we park and hop out, learn levels to this whole thang
Old school, play the O'Jays

Must it take a life for hateful eyes
To glisten once again
Five hundred years like gelignite
Have blown us all to hell
What savior rests while on his cross we die
Forgotten freedom burns
Has the Shepherd led his lambs astray
To the bigot and the gun

Must it take a life for hateful eyes
To glisten once again
Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
Singin' drunken lullabies

I watch and stare as Roisin's eyes
Turn a darker shade of red
And the bullet with this sniper lie
In their bloody gutless cell
Must we starve on crumbs from long ago
Through bars these men made steel
Is it a great or little thing we fought
Knelt the conscience blessed to kill
[Chorus]
Must it take a life for hateful eyes
To glisten once again
Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
Singin' drunken lullabies

[Bridge]
Ah, but maybe it's the way we were taught
Or maybe it`s the way we thought
But a smile never grins without tears to begin
For each kiss is a cry we all lost
Though nothing is left to gain
But for the banshee that stole the grave
Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess
Singin' drunken lullabies

[Verse 3]
I sit in and dwell on faces past
Like memories seem to fade
No color left, but black and white
And soon we'll all turn grey
But may these shadows rise to walk again
With lessons truly learnt
When the blossom flowers in each our hearts
Shall beat a new found flame

Must it take a life for hateful eyes
To glisten once again
Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess

Why they call me El Chivo? 'Cause I feed all my people (El Chivo)
Been rich since nine-six, 'fore the weed went legal (Bags)
Big farms, new cars, and a few jars
The Cereal Milk taste so crazy I'ma need more (Receipts)
Yeah, I just opened up a weed store (Weed store)
Blue bags got your boy in a weed war (I'm in a weed war)
Kris, they ain't smoking like this (Nah)
The Gelato with the mints, that's a hell of a mix, damn

Me desperté relax, voy a desayunar
Un Cereal Milk de la Cookies que ahora es medicinal
Las vibras del papel me hicieron levantar
Con el humo que aviento todo esto se va a soltar
El Chivo ahora aquí está, la quarter está de más
Me pasa el toque, la devuelve y todo está normal

[Verse 2: Berner]
Dog, this shit smell like candy (Like candy)
In the cut, rollin' up, getting high with my family (With my family)
In the Andes, lookin' for the seeds they grew in the '60's (I'm in Columbia)
All this smoke in the studio, it got your boy dizzy (It got me dizzy)
I got bags in my trunk, where the glow tray? (Glow tray)
Groupie girls in my show wanna role play (Get my drama on)
I'm so paid I eat steak on a gold plate
My watch look like a block full of snowflake
Grow something if you got it
The Cello got us right, the whole world want it (Damn)

De los Corredones originales
Con mis compas de Grupo Firme
Dice, más o menos, así

[Verso 1]
Yo no soy lúcido, mucho menos presumido
Pero sí me doy a respetar
A los envidiosos vieran cómo los detesto
Porque nomás hablan por hablar
Pacas de billetes, produciendo diariamente
Pues, mi meta ha sido duplicar
Odio las mentiras, pero adoro a mi familia
Y por ellos yo voy a luchar

[Coro 1]
Y la Cruz de Elota llevo en mi pecho
Ranchito que no he de olvidar
Revivir mi infancia, pero ya tengo ganancias
Y, gracias a Dios, ya andamos bien vestidos
Zapatito' fino' los que me ven aportar
Ahorita andamos bateando, poco a poco progresando
Y nadie me va a tumbar
[Interludio]
Y pura Marca MP con Bachato
Así suena Grupo Firme, compa' Edwin (Uh)
Y la Banda Nuevo Estilo, mi viejo
Y puro music VIP, viejo
Puro art and music, viejo

[Verso 2]
No soy traficante, pero festejo a lo grande
Y con amigos jalo un buen bandón
Tengo mil veinte años y el que ocupe de mi mano
Tendrá cien por ciento mi apoyo
Ni rico ni pobre, pero tengo lo que quiero
Y mis gustos siempre me los doy
Mucho le agradezco al viejón por sus consejos
Y por todo lo que me inculcó

[Coro 2]
Y mientras hay que disfrutar la vida
Porque cualquier día se nos va
Muchas cosas me han pasado
Pero nunca me he quebrado
Y todo gracias al Señor de arriba
Que me cuida y me protege todo el tiempo del mal
Por el valle ruleteando, en mi carro ando zumbando
El güero, se oye mentar

Los mares de las playas se van
Se tiñen los colores de gris

Jump out the window, then put the mask on

See me in the NYC
You can never swing by me
Hope we'll never link up

Show a different side of humanity

Save you from a home invasion

When the light shine, I go python

There's no way in my right mind

I know you heard 'bout my last fight
'Cause I win, over and over again
Battlin' evil, I'm hopin' to win
Fightin' my demons, I'm nice for a reason
Enticed with the bleedin', I'm showin' my sins
How can you expect me to stay sane? Protect me

[Intro: Manuel Turizo & Ozuna]
Prometí olvidarte
Pero a dónde voy llevo tu recuerdo conmigo
Es mi corazón que no te dice adiós
Pero en mi mente te lo digo, oh

[Pre-Coro: Manuel Turizo]
Hoy quiero decirle adiós a la soledad
Salir a buscarte, sin ti no puedo más
Voy a confesar lo que no dije jamás
No hay punto final

[Coro: Ozuna & Manuel Turizo]
Yo te confieso, me vuelvo loco cuando tengo tu cariño
Soy esclavo de tus besos, aceleran mis latidos
También que sepas que sería poco decir ""Quiero estar contigo""
Tu nombre: mi primer verso, y de último: tu apellido

[Verso 1: Manuel Turizo]
En mi desvelo
Cada que cierro los ojos yo a ti te veo
Poco a poco en tu recuerdo siento el deseo
De compartir contigo lo que ya no puedo
""Volverá"" le digo to' el día a la soledad
El brillo de su mirar regresará
Y se irá la oscuridad que me está matando
""Volverá"" le digo to' el día a la soledad
Moriría si regresaras
Lady, no perdamos tiempo y dime la verdad
[Coro: Ozuna & Manuel Turizo]
Yo te confieso, me vuelvo loco cuando tengo tu cariño
Soy esclavo de tus besos, aceleran mis latidos
También que sepas que sería poco decir ""Quiero estar contigo""
Tu nombre: mi primer verso, y de último: tu apellido

[Verso 2: Ozuna]
(Jaja; Ozuna)
Sería poco ya decir que quiero estar contigo
Sería poco que tú y yo seamo' solo amigo'
Hay mucho má' en tu corazón que en el mío (Oh, oh)
Quiero abrigarte y abrazarte, que no te dé frío
Nunca conocer la soledad
Seguro no querrá' que se acabe la madrugá' (Ah, ah-ah)
Un poco 'e vallenato pa' lo viejo recordar
Bachatita' de Romeo cuando ella quiere bailar (Oh, oh)

[Puente: Ozuna]
Lo más que me gusta de ella: no necesita apariencia
Tiene diez amiga' y ninguna son competencia
Sabe lo que da, que no lo opine la audiencia
Entra pa' la disco y se me convierte en tendencia
Lo más que me gusta de ella: no necesita apariencia
Tiene die' amiga' y ninguna son competencia
Sabe lo que da, que no lo opine la audiencia (Woh-oh)
Entra pa' la disco y se me convierte en tendencia (Baby)
[Coro: Manuel Turizo]
Yo te confieso, me vuelvo loco cuando tengo tu cariño
Soy esclavo de tus besos, aceleran mis latidos
También que sepas que sería poco decir ""Quiero estar contigo""

Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone
'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know
Before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared when I'm not here
But I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

[Verse 2]
Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait
He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away
I know I act tough, but there's a churnin' in my gut
'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough
Before I left, he hugged my neck and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause you're leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared I might be here
But I'll always be right there
Even though you're leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere
[Bridge]
Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
I never thought I'd see the day I had to say goodbye
Daddy, please don't go, I can't do this on my own
There's no way that I can walk this road alone
Daddy grabbed my hand and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, boy, I ain't scared
I won't be here, but I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

Everybody wanna fuck with me for benefits now
Man, I wish my nigga Smelly could've seen me lit now
Sit down, maybe roll up, blow a spliff down
Time go by, niggas change so much
Why the fuck these niggas looking at my chain so much?
They just mad 'cause I departed from the game so much
One false move and the gang gon' bust

Could have did it to me, lil' nigga, you were scared to
You a bluff and you not who you appear to
You'd be starstruck if you see a nigga near you
And your bitch wanna fuck, I don't care to
Careful, if I say links, plan's canceled
I can have your shorty in my bed doing dance moves
Fuck that, let's get right back to the real shit

Mama stressed out, whole lot she gotta deal with
Swear every real nigga gon' feel this
Smokin' on drugs 'cause there's too much to deal with

My mama know about the pain, thought I'd never change
But looking back, for the fame, I felt the same
I was stuck up in the streets, but I had a brain
I ain't have no money, we was looking for a nigga chain
And shit, all I ever wanted was to have a name
Had a lot of shit to lose, not enough to gain
And that fuck nigga changed, went against the grain
Found out my homie went fed, almost went insane
Strictly business, you ain't with it, you get parked, nigga
I don't know you, you wasn't with me from the start, nigga

Me and Bubba tryna catch an opp after dark, nigga

It was Christmas Eve, babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
""Won't see another one""
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

[Verse 2: Shane MacGowan]
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So, Happy Christmas
I love you, baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

[Verse 3: Kirsty MacColl]
They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

You were handsome!
You were pretty, Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks, they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

Were singing, ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out

Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed

I'm at, I'm at Sueco's, bitch

[Chorus]
Fast
Four hundred on the dash
Fifty-five bills
Buck fifty for the tax on the bag
I don't really like to brag
Vetements socks when I'm steppin' out of Saks
I'ma hit in the morning 'cause I'm whiskey dickin'
Got my brother out in Cashville flippin' chickens
Free bro from the can, I ain't talkin' whippits
Bitch, I make beats and bad decisions

[Verse 1]
You at Sueco's
Stop the bitchin'
I ain't really fuckin' with you if you ain't with the vision
First time she came through, pulled down my britches
I ain't spendin' no bread, but I'll pay her a visit
I'm at LIV goin' up, but you can't get in it
She want a hit, I'm rollin' up, got that Popeye spinach
Told me that I'm a child, told her, ""Quit the kiddin'""
I'ma pass it to my rell, let him hit the kitten
[Pre-Chorus]
She a vixen on the cam, so I grab my iPhone
She dumb with the head, got me doin' a eye roll
She bad on film, gotta check out the B-roll
Put my D in her V, got her singin' a C note

[Chorus]

Four hundred on the dash
Fifty-five bills

Got my brother out in Cashville flippin' chickens
Free bro from the can, I ain't talkin' whippits
Bitch, I make beats and bad decisions

[Verse 2]
You at Sueco's
Get with the program
Light-skin bitch off that Lindsay Lohan
She off the dust
She off the Hilary Duff
Baby, I ain't tryna cuff, I'm just tryna bust
Wait, hol' up
You gotta play with my nuts, hmm
I'ma make a beat out your butt, hmm
007, James Bond
Double Oreo stuffed
Double up my funds
[Pre-Chorus]
She a vixen on the cam, so I grab my iPhone
She dumb with the head, got me doin' a eye roll
She bad on film, gotta check out the B-roll
Put my D in her V, got her singin' a C note

Immunity, long overdue
Contagion, I exhale you
Naive, I opened up to you

Now, contagion, I exhale you

The deceiver says, he says
""You belong to me
You don't wanna breathe the light of the others
Fear the light, fear the breath
Fear the others for eternity""
But I hear them now, inhale the clarity
Hear the venom, the venom in
What you say inoculated
Bless this immunity

Weave my allegorical elegy

Enumerate all that I'm to do
Calculating steps away from you

Growing through division from mania

Exhale, expel
Recast my tale

Forfeit all control

Exorcise the spectacle
Exorcise the malady

Father, I stretch
Stretch my hands to You

[Verse]
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to You)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like"" (Stretch my hands to You)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father, I stretch)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (Stretch my hands to You)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, ""It ain't Christ-like""
[Outro]

You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your

Teach you how to be sweet like mamma and how to be tough

Anywhere, I don't care

You would have walked by and stole my heart
Summer night at the county fair
I would have stopped in my tracks and stared
And I'd have known right then and there

You got a pass around nigga, he a hot potato
I told him, “Eat it or get out, that’s your ultimatum
But stop licking my pussy hard, that shit aggravating”
Uh, he ain’t mine, I just let him eat me out from time to time
Call that pussy pootie tang, ‘cause I got the rinnegan
He can’t compare me to none of these bitches

And I ain’t fucked you in a minute, why you still claim me?
Bet if he ever hit this pussy, he gon' still stalk me
And if you got a new bitch, why you still callin’?
And I look better than that hoe, that’s why she made you block me
I like to show out for them haters talkin' bad about me
Tryin' hard to find a flaw, but you still watchin' (Hey)
Freak nasty motherfucker, kiss with the tongue

And shawty you ain't no different
These days it's hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no, no, no

You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
But if you're alone, then

And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home

No new friends, no, no, no

This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys 'round me saying, ""Get money and fuck these hoes""
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name

Don’t you dare try and reappear after you already got me standing here
I can’t believe you would come at me looking for a little bit of sympathy
Like I wasn’t the one you left all alone crying looking like a hot mess
Don’t show your face ‘round here anymore honey this is something you better get through your head

[Chorus]
'Cause I’m giving you up, just like I did them Marlboro Lights
And I’m giving you up, the same way I did the whiskey on ice
And it’s all so tough you turn me into a man I don’t even recognize
I’m giving you up, the same way you did me out in the moonlight

[Verse 2]
What the hell are you thinking coming round to visit
Completely uninvited messing with my brain again
Couldn’t give me the satisfaction of forgetting your existence show up when I thought I finally found the end
Don’t be coming over looking for a conversation
Dropping little hints that you want me back again
‘Cause I’m so sick and tired of the little lies you tell me
So here is all I’m saying baby better listen in

[Chorus]
I’m giving you up just like I did them Marlboro Lights
And I’m giving you up the same way I did the whiskey on ice
And it’s all so tough you turn me into a man i don’t even recognize
I’m giving you up the same way you did me out in the moonlight
[Verse 3]
I’m letting go of all the things that held their grips on me with you being my first priority
‘Cause death isn’t worth the weight of your love no more
And i’m packing up leaving closing shop
There ain’t no room for you in this heart no more so I’m letting go

[Chorus]
And I’m giving you up just like I did them Marlboro Lights
And I’m giving you up, the same way I did the whiskey on ice
And it’s oh so tough you turn me into a man I don’t even recognize
I’m giving you up the same way you did me out in the moonlight
Yeah I’m giving you up, yeah I’m giving you up, yeah I’m giving you upEmbed","bet , bet , af  , lit  , lit  , lit  , stan "

There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground

Standin' so tall, they think I might got stilts

Probably because you're the one playin' the mind games
You hate me because I don't let you play no mind games

And his cake and her cake, where the honeymoon gon' be
With a new 'do, with boo-coos of cold cash
I swear that's the furthest damn thing from me

I'm tyin' one on, takin' it hard

""I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier""
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin’ one day I’d find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin’ not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days, yeah

I was a Highwoman
And a mother from my youth
For my children, I did what I had to do
My family left Honduras when they killed the Sandinistas
We followed a coyote through the dust of Mexico
Every one of them except for me survived
And I am still alive

[Verse 2: Amanda Shires]
I was a healer
I was gifted as a girl
I laid hands upon the world
Someone saw me sleeping naked in the noon sun
I heard ""witchcraft"" in the whispers and I knew my time had come
The bastards hung me at the Salem gallows hill
But I am living still

[Verse 3: Yola]
I was a freedom rider
When we thought the South had won
Virginia in the spring of '61
I sat down on the Greyhound that was bound for Mississippi
My mother asked me if that ride was worth my life
And when the shots rang out, I never heard the sound
But I am still around
[Chorus]
And I'll take that ride again
And again, and again, and again, and again

[Verse 4: Natalie Hemby]
I was a preacher
My heart broke for all the world
But teaching was unrighteous for a girl
In the summer, I was baptized in the mighty Colorado
In the winter, I heard the hounds and I knew I had been found
And in my Savior's name, I laid my weapons down
But I am still around

[Verse 5: All]
We are The Highwomen
Singing stories still untold
We carry the sons you can only hold
We are the daughters of the silent generations
You send our hearts to die alone in foreign nations
And they return to us as tiny drops of rain
But we will still remain

[Chorus]
And we'll come back again
And again, and again, and again, and again
We'll come back again

Honeybee
Could you imagine where our lives would lead?
That silly ring, it wasn't meant to be
Luckily, you saw in me something I couldn't see
Honeybee
I can't imagine how my life would be
If all your gravity did not hit me
Oh, don't you see? Darling, my honeybee

[Pre-Chorus]
But here we are
After all the messes and confessions
To the stars
That we never really owned as ours

[Chorus]
And if our world comes tumbling down
I never could forgive myself for leaving out
You're the one, you are the only one

[Verse 2]
Such a fool
I took your love and I bent all the rules
You took the blow and didn't let it show
Stuck around to let me know
Built a family of our own
Look around
We made a garden of the love we found
So many reasons I would fight to stay
You're the courage when I fade
Take a look at what we've made
[Pre-Chorus]
But here we are
After all the messes and confessions
To the scars
That we never really owned as ours

[Chorus]
And if our world comes tumbling down
I never could forgive myself for leaving out
You're the one, you are the only one

[Bridge]
Won't you decide?
Won't you decide?
I want you to soar
Don't doubt anymore
(Little by little, we'll meet in the middle)
Won't you decide? (If that's alright)
Won't you decide?
(I hope you can hear me, I needed you near me)
I want you to soar (You save my life)
Don't doubt anymore (Let's keep this between you and I)

[Pre-Chorus]
And if our world comes tumbling down
I never could forgive myself for leaving out
[Chorus]
And if our world comes tumbling down
(If our world comes tumbling down)
I never could forgive myself for leaving out
(I never could forgive myself)
You're the one, you are the only one
And if our world comes tumbling down
(The world comes tumbling down)
I never could forgive myself, I'll say it now
(I never could forgive myself)
You're the one, you are the only one11Embed","bet , af  , af  , lit  , lit  , "

Do you still think about it, of what you did?
Still see your old apartment, like a bad trip
Wish I could forget all the places we've been

Boy, you know how to make a girl cry
Was sleeping in a bed full of lies
And now that I'm older, I can see why

'Cause you had me so low, low, low
You only seemed tall
'Cause you stunted my grow-grow-growth
I only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you

49,HURT,Witt Lowry,"Hurt Lyrics[Intro: Deion Reverie]
It doesn't feel right with you gone
It hurts too much to be left alone
I know I was never in your plans
But it doesn’t feel right in her bed (But I love it)
It hurts to know

[Verse 1: Witt Lowry & Deion Reverie]
Yeah, if only I knew to love you, I would lose me
Would wake up just to go back asleep
I hope you and him live happily
But the memories, girl, you gon' have to keep
All the lies that you told me are on repeat
I don't know what’s real, you lie through your teeth
If I could take the feelings that I had for you
Just like our pics, I'd press delete
I've been contemplatin' a hundred times
About a hundred facts I found out were lies
I know you used me just to pass the time
But you can never say I didn't fucking try
What you meant to me is what I mean to art
Was real with you from the fuckin' start
You played games with my fuckin' heart
And after you, I fell a-fuckin'-part, damn
I know we weren’t perfect, I guess I thought we were worth it
I guess your love was uncertain, you’re busy at the club flirtin'
Friends just keep feedin’ you bourbon
Car smellin' like his cologne and your weed
For months I would think, ""Is he better than me?""
I know that he can't love you better than me
I wonder, was it you intention to cheat?
Can't believe I believed you
Keep telling myself I don’t need you
When talking to her, I just see you
Alone, but surrounded by people
Maybe one day you'll change, and he'll reap the benefits
'Cause all you left me were questions and pain
Don't know why I care if you're feelin' the same
I need to just get you up out of my brain (It hurts to know)
[Pre-Chorus: Witt Lowry & Deion Reverie]
I know I was never the plan
You're not the you you would claim
You're not the person I met
Don't know the you you became
Was addicted though to the pain
And the constant games that you play
Just being real when I say that still (It hurts to know)
And I tried to give you a chance
But things were never the same
I ended up all alone
You ended up with a lame
Was addicted though to the pain
And the constant games that you play
Just being real when I say that still (It hurts to know)

[Chorus: Deion Reverie]
It doesn't feel right with you gone
It hurts too much to be left alone
I know I was never in your plans
But it doesn't feel right in her bed
It hurts to know

[Verse 2: Witt Lowry & Deion Reverie]
Still, you're who my family adores
Maybe that's why it's hard to ignore you
After all of the time that we spent
Sad to think that I still didn't know you
Woke up in a city that we've never been to
I wish I could show you
Even my music, I put it below you
Just know I woulda done anything for you (It hurts to know)
Remember I told you I felt inadequate
Because you came from a family with money
And me, I have nothing, I work as a waiter
With visions of turning myself into something
The music was buzzing, but I couldn't pay for a bill
Off of people just saying they love it
Had class in the morning, had work in the evening
Then write through the night with no food in my stomach (It hurts to know)
Just know that it's hard
Damn, girl, it's so fucking hard
I keep tellin' myself that I need to move on
But it's hard to get close when you have up a guard
I know everything changed, the old me would prolly feel shame
For the bottles I've bought on my card
You would go to the bar while I was stuck working the double
To pay for the tank in my car (It hurts to know)
And I guess that it's best I pretend like I don't give a fuck
Even though, to be real, I'm a mess
I've been trying to find anything I can find
Just to fill in the hole in my chest
And it's sad to believe that a picture with me
Is a picture of you and an ex
You should know that it takes everything within me
To delete when I'm sending a text, like
[Chorus: Deion Reverie]
It doesn't feel right with you gone
It hurts too much to be left alone (It hurts to know)
I know I was never in your plans (It hurts to know)
And I ain't just can't get you out my head
It hurts to know21Embed","bet , bet , af  , af  , woke , stan "

I sold my soul, I'm waiting for my pay in full
I only want your dying love, I seen enough

Maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give, but
It seems like it never really was enough

I feel left out, I don't see how
My whole life can change in one week
I don't mind my own reflection
I don't see how you've been let down
Don't speak 'less you have to
Why you always seem in a bad mood?
Your whole life, you had an attitude
One day, is that so bad for you?

I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if it got that bad
I'm sorry I can't help you
Somebody should've had your back

I tried, but I don't think so
Maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give, but
It seems like it never really was enough

I changed my whole life when
I learned to ignore them
I changed my whole life up
Maybe it was not enough
I don't think I'm allowed to
Make a deal with your selfish ways
They're acting vicious out there
There's lots of demons out here

I'm sorry if it got that bad
I'm sorry I can't help you

Pull up in motorcades, I got a show today
This all I'm tryna do, hustle and motivate
Choppers a throwaway, hustle the Hova way
That's why they follow me, huh? They think I know the way
'Cause I took control of things, ballin' the solo way
And if you pattern my trend, I make you my protege
Slauson Ave soldier raised, niggas don't know them days
Take you in back of the buildings, make you expose your age
Take you across the tracks, make you explode a face
Now you official now, but you got a soul to save
I just been cookin' that new, I'm 'bout to drop in a few
Think if I call it the great, the people gon' call it the truth
Ain't really trip on the credit, I just paid all of my dues
I just respected the game, now my name all in the news
Trippin' on all of my moves, quote me on this, got a lot more to prove
Remember I came in this bitch fresh out the county with nothin' to lose

[Chorus: Maurice David Wade]
And I don't do this for nothin', nah, from the ground up, yeah
But I don't do this shit for nothin', no, no, not at all, yeah

So I don't do this shit for nothin', no, not at all, all

So I don't do this shit for nothin', not at all, from the ground up

Back in this bitch like I never left
Stand for some shit that you never rep
Passing through stages in life
Through the ups and the downs like it's all just another test
Live by the rules like a fuckin' ref
I got respect in a hundred sets
Too many chains, need another chest
Playin' no games if it wasn't chess
Cut from that cloth that you couldn't stretch
Cut from that circle you couldn't test
Heavily pressured and under stress
Even though niggas ain't show it, we was a mess
Honest attempt, play him to the left
Judge a young nigga by they address
Left us no option, what they expect?
Only thing we knew for sure was to bang the set
Fuck livin' basic, I'm takin' risks
Fuck what they sayin', I'm sayin' this
Don't waste your time, it don't make you rich
It don't mean nothin', so fuck 'em, let's make a grip
Double up, triple up, make it six
Ballin' so hard, you could pay a bitch
Lead to the lake if they wanna fish
Make sure them niggas around you stick to the script
This should be written in stone
You should come visit my zone
Don't take my word, double-check all of my flows
Ask 'em how Hussle got on
But fuck what you heard
This is for who walked down that road
Sold everything but they soul
Straight off the curb, real niggas rich as you nerds
Addressed to whom it may concern
I don't do this for nothin', nah

Got rid of you right before the lies became considerable

Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

You're not alright, I’m not alright
I like to drink and to smoke to take away the pain
And you don't remember all of your mistakes
And when our hearts aren't broke, they're out of place
You're not alright, I'm not alright

[Verse 2]
Let's roll
You and I don't belong in a place like this
Baby, let's roll
We don't need to believe everything they think
When it's all so, uh
Headed down that road and you don't gotta go down solo
No, don't let me go

[Pre-Chorus]
Got no patience, conversation drivin' you up the wall
I've been perfect, you're a goddess, no sarcasm at all
You say you're sorry, but don't know what you're sorry for, no
No point in keeping the score

[Chorus]
You like to drink and to smoke to take away the pain
And I don't remember all of my mistakes
And every high got low with no one to blame
You're not alright, I'm not alright
[Drop]
You're not alright, I'm not alright
I like to drink and to smoke to take away the pain
And you don't remember all of your mistakes

16,Some Say,Nea,"I’m Outstanding Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was born three-six-seventy-two, I think it's on a Wednesday
Hail to the moon, just like Kunta Kinte
That means I'm gifted from the get-go, Mom's you never let go
Mad thanks for raising me right, bro
You gave me confidence to stop the nonsense
Didn't live in Bel Air like the Fresh Prince
Times are hard, times are rough
Didn't have Toys 'R' Us toys, but I had enough love
Plus the guidance from above
To go to the park, sweatin', push and shove
Maybe then for a dunk like you told me
Then there were a few times when Dad had to scold me
Prayed for my safety, I know how you was feeling
Didn't want me wheeling and get to drug-dealing
Remember when you asked me this one day
Who I wanna be like, I said Dr. J
Then you said, ""Good, now you gotta go
Take the damn ball and slam it through the hole""
Mom cracked a smile, Daddy gave a frown
I said to myself, ""I can't let them down""
So make way, I'm coming in for a landing
And nothing's gonna' stop me, from being outstanding

[Interlude]
I'm outstanding
[Verse 2]
Now let's skip to the time when I was fifteen
Shaq is in the house, no, Shaq is on the scene
Now my name's in papers, girls caught the vapors
Kids look up to me like a skyscraper
Now, a role model, I mean a role figure
Then I ask myself, can I get any bigger?
My dream is coming true, but coming true slowly
Then I remember what Mom and Dad told me
""Remember this, son, you are the one
Shoot your gift like a gun and never forget where you come from
You're young, gifted, and Black
If they can't say Shaquille O'Neal then make 'em scream, Shaq!'""
Like the fam do, in the stands too
When I freak the funk on a dunk they, ""Ah! Ooh!""
From high school to college, they gave me enough knowledge
Make that gift and now it's time for me to fulfill my dream
To be in the [leaders' game?] like Hakeem
I'll make the backboards shatter
Fans chit-chatter
Even make the other centers get madder
That's me, who can it be?
The master of disaster, seven foot three
Brother, ain't no other in the nation
I'm born from my mother but I'm God's creation
I'm outstanding
[Interlude]
I'm outstanding

[Verse 3]
Cause now I'm outstanding
Wave your hands and pump your fist
When I'm on the court you know it's strictly, ""Swish!""
Cause there's some things that I gotta do:
Tape up the ankle, pump up my Shaq shoe
And now it's time to take care of business
To run up and down the court with Nick and Dennis
Scott, but I won't stop
Gotta keep striving until I reach the top
Gonna take a peek over the mountain
I flow like a fountain
Peace, I gotta go! And I'm out and…
But before I go, wave your hands
Peace to all my family, friends and fam
I'm outstanding

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
When the emcees came to live out their name
Inscribed in the halls and the walls of fame
Balancing life, wrote both the yin and yang
Hands bury the man and they raised the son, Lorraine
That's a play on words, they say herb ain't all the same
Slaves in prison and they some unchained
While everybody in my gang a star, DJ Preem
Screaming through the sun roof, ""Money still ain't a thing""
While I'm spending small bank, asking ""Where is my change?""
Carpool with the homies, saving gas in my tank
I think like a billionaire, I spend less than I make
Strong minded, I should bench way more than my weight
Women been leading the way since Roxanne Shante
And the Unit had Flav and Jay had Marcy neighbors that waved
Lookin' confused, I'm like ""Cool, maybe it's age""
When I see afro puffs, I think maybe it's Rage
Maybe it's staged, they trippin', and they say they got beef
Ain't an emcee on this Earth that make me feel afraid
Wu-Tang for the children, that's the scripture and phrase
See my goals from a bird's view like Trae Underage

Chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-cha
[Verse 2: GZA]
When I'm so off the radar, it's very hard to find me
In space, a selfie with the Earth behind me
You follow the leader, the track is off the meter
A lot of rap is weak, low frequency in the tweeters
Very inaudible, clock radio speakers
Quietly whispering is a world of WikiLeakers
Forget the gaudiness, my method is nauseant
Transferring ideas into the brains of the audience
The street poet gave this special artform a global reach
Who earned your ear and then your heart by giving a local speech
Weaving wonder with words as potent as a sorcery
Not witchcraft, but a list of terms in the glossary
Well written rap bound to have a greater impact
On a listener for the fact, it's well intact
An emcee should electrify, beautify, strive to
Empower, inspire, transform a worldview

[Chorus: Rapsody & D'Angelo]
Back in the days (Yeah), when niggas wore fades (Yeah)
Silk tied caps, just tryna catch a wave (Boy, you sharp)
Tryna catch a wave (Liquid swords sharp, boy)

I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out

I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?

It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'

How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out

Here's the part where things get messy
Here’s the part where we say what we haven't before

No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
You ain't stingy, split your tablets with me
You won't flinch when camera's flashing, flashing
Not fake laid back, no, it's natural
And I think you made for the life I lead
I'm not fake patient, I don't fake sick, huh
That kinda coffin don't need lean
Rest in peace
Got this lust for life in me, yeah
Horny for the game, uh
First they kiss, then they bite soft, uh
Then that bitch wanna play it off, huh
Fuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes
While serpents shake some brand new scales
I need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos
Acting familiar, took all the rock
And turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
And he ungrateful, they don't say thank you
They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions
Fuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal
Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill
It's either real or real
Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field
Skin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel
Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel

Thinkin' 'bout my grandmama and shit (Wait a minute, who are you?)
I got the number one record, they acknowledged the jit (Ayy, yo, Kid)
They goin' crazy when they play it, head bobbin' and shit
And I'm just somewhere fucked up thinkin' 'bout my father and shit
They found him dead a couple days before I started tour
Same day I flew back to the city from Miami
I was out there with the family
Just lookin' at my daughter
Thinkin' to myself like, ""Damn, my baby look just like my daddy""
Same time I got the news, my shit went number one, that's fucked up
That shit there was confusin', a lil' bit, you know I flew in with the stick
Okay, like let me know what's up before I lose it in this bitch
And everybody tryna talk, I ain't tryna talk, I'm tryna click
I'm tryna send somebody wit' him
Somebody let me know what's happenin'
My last name K-I-R-K, Kirk
You know how I rock behind my daddy
You know I never gave a fuck about the world, just about my family
How the fuck I make it to the top same day I lost the nigga that had me?
How a nigga perform on BET and a year ago couldn't afford a sandwich?
I had to move in with TG when I went broke movin' out to Cali
What you know about smilin' every day for all your fans, actin' like you happy?
I spent a hundred thousand layin' my daddy to rest, but I ain't braggin'
I got some questions, I'm a die about respect if I don't get answers
My mama stood up in that chair, took it like a G when she had cancer
My brother be thinkin' that we don't love him and let him struggle like we ain't family
Like I won't give up all I got to see you happy, nigga
We shocked the world, everybody know what's happenin', nigga
I'm still Lil' Jon Jon, my song, it just went platinum, nigga
We on our own time, let's go move out to Cali, nigga
Put the kids in homeschool, let's go get us a mansion, nigga
Let's raise our kids right, let's watch the shit we teach 'em, nigga
Let's start a business for you so they can't say that you leechin', nigga
How I know I'm the chosen one, 'cause sometimes when I be speakin', nigga
Like on this song, I ain't rappin', I'm preachin', nigga

13,Isis,Joyner Lucas,"Isis Lyrics[Intro]
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or better known as ADHD, is a mental disorder that affects an individual's ability to focus
Causing them to move around more frequently
They may also have trouble controlling their impulsive behaviors

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
One time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)
Two times for the homies in the chow hall (Whoa)
Three times for them hoes on the internet
Shittin' on niggas when they really should get out more
Four times for the days that were all bad (Woo!)
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back (Yeah)
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— (Brap, brap, brap)

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Kidnap a nigga like ISIS (Whoa)
Turn a whole world to a crisis (Whoa)
Walk around the city with a ice pick
I been paranoid, usually, I ain't like this (Boop, boop)
Ain't no tellin' how crazy I might get, uh (Woo!)
Beat the police with a nightstick (Boop)
In my whole life, I been lifeless
Now I'm so fly, I'm a muhfuckin' flight risk (Woo! Whoa)
Fuck a couple hoes 'til I pass out (Whoa)
Niggas throwin' stones at my glass house (Whoa)
I remember sleepin' on my dad's couch (Whoa)
Now I got the Bentley, and it's blacked out (Whoa)
Family lookin' at me like a cash cow (Whoa)
Errybody dissin' just to have clout (Whoa)
Thought you had a chance, now you assed out
Nigga, I'm the muhfuckin' man, where you at now? (Whoa)
Fuck it, I'ma hit 'em 'til they jumpin'
I ain't trippin', this is nothin' (Brap, brap, brap)
I been livin' in the dungeon
I done held a couple grudges
Went to hell and got abducted
Meet the devil, I'm his cousin
I ain't settlin' for nothin' (Brap, brap, brap)
Got a metal in the truck, I keep a semi when I'm bussin'
Niggas duckin' (Bop)
Even Stevie Wonder could've see it comin' (Brrrap, brap, bop)
I ain't judgin', I just want the money, I don't need a budget
I been hungry, I ain't got no oven (Bop, bop, brrrap, brap)
But I got the munchies, nigga
How you gon' move on the front line? (Woo!)
If I don't fuck with you, I just cut ties (Whoa)
My high school teacher said I'd never be shit
Tell that bitch that I turned out just fine (Joyner)
And no, I don't know you for the twelfth time (Woo!)
We do not share the same bloodline (No)
You love to run your mouth like a tough guy
Hope you keep the same energy when it's crunch time (Woo!)
[Interlude]
According to the American Psychiatric Association
It affects roughly eight percent of children
And two percent of adults
Commonly believed to only affect boys
Because they are perceived as rowdy and rambunctious

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
One time for them prayin' on my downfall (Yeah)
Two times for them bitches in the South Shore (Whoa)
Three times for them days on the block
Gettin' chased by the cops like a motherfuckin' outlaw
Four times for them days that were all bad (Woo!)
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back (Yeah)
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— (Brap, brap, brap)

[Verse 2: Logic]
Me and Joyner need a couple hearses (Woo!)
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses
Everybody livin' on the surface
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it
What's beef?
Beef is when you murder motherfuckers on a beat
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Nah, nah, what's beef?
Beef is brothers dyin' over shit
That never mattered in the first place, lyin' in the street
What's peace?
Peace is when you leave it in the past, let it heal like a cast
When enough time pass, then you blast
Kinda like John Wick, bars like a convict
Fuck around and you don't wanna start shit, woo!
Comin' with the hot shit, all they do is talk shit
You could never top it, boy, just stop, stop it
High and drunk, call that HD vision
All these other motherfuckers full of indecision
And I murder with precision all over your television
I'm numero uno, number one and you is just a subdivision
Never listen, we gon' leave them missin'
That's the mission like ISIS (ISIS)
Ain't no time to bicker over who the nicest
It's Logic, it's obvious, just ask the audience
I've come to body this shit (Body this shit)
Yes, it's egregious, I'm Regis
You Kelly, you pussy, you pussy
Don't push me, I'm Louis Vuitton
You at Target with your mom
On the internet still hatin' on my last post (I hate this nigga)
I just sent a steak back at Mastro's, my god
Me and Joyner need a couple hearses (Woo!)
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses
Everybody livin' on the surface
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it
Yeah, uh, far from the minimum, killin' 'em with no Ritalin
And 5'9"" was the middleman to get 'em in the same room
Now we on the same tune, and we sealed the game's doom
The illest of lyricists on the same shit
RattPack, clap back on the gang shit
Do it for the love of rap, not for the fame shit, woo!
[Chorus: Logic]
One time for the Grammy that I never got
Two times for the Garden that I sold out
Three times for the street crimes that I committed
Yeah, I did it, but thank God that I made it out
Four times 'cause I'm a fuckin' bastard
Five times Platinum with my last shit
Six times for the beats and the rhymes
Fuck the heat and the crime
Keep the peace like a waistline, woo!

Raised by the internet, final stage, yo
We could do anything by the age, yo
Niggas thought they was too cool for Myspace, yo
Had the iPod Touch with the Redsn0w
Cydia, but you could pirate all the apps though
They would hack security cams by the back doors
Nigga, this was Limewire on crack, though
The Touch was anything you could've asked for
Jailbreakin' it and you was hot shit, yeah
What if you could do the same for the whip, yeah?
Turn the X into a Batmobile rip, yeah
I can't wait 'til a nigga get to stuntin'
Get a Tesla and take it to West Coast Customs
Turn the touchscreen to iOS for fun
Make the auto-pilot do a donut, go dumb, man
Tell that nigga Elon I'm sorry
Tell my mom safety features ain't adjusted
Pulled up, doors up at the party
Like I didn't cop that shit for nothin'
Niggas can pull up in the 'Rari
But all you can change is paint and some fuck shit
And you gotta drive that shit, that ain't fun man
Need some shit I can hack, like fuck it

Or at a party in the hills
At the bottom of the bottle
Or when you're tripping on some pills

Packed a bag and ran away

'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA""

'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA""

And that is when I realized that I was alone
And all the vibrant colors from the lights fade away
And I don't care what they say

In the backseat of a taxi
And you're telling me you wanna kiss me
But we shouldn't 'cause we're just friends

Maybe we could go get lost tonight
At least we know that we gave it a try

So why don't we go out and get a drink in the West end?
Smoke a cigarette and talk shit about exes
Take a couple shots and see where the night ends
Stop pretending like we're just friends

Why don't we go out and get a drink in the West end?
One more dance, are you feeling the tension?
Take a couple shots and see where the night ends
Stop pretending like we're just friends

Stop pretending like we're just friends

I ain't one to floss, but I got plaques, run it back
Once I touch down, I go deep like a running back
Just jumped on the private jet and rolled a joint
Played the beat then wrote that joint
Wrote a whole movie, then I sold that joint
Fuck Illuminati, that boy 6ix got my back
6ix made this beat, 6ix bring the heat you got on repeat
Word on the street
Can't no one compete, I'm spectacular
That boy got the sauce on the RAGÚ-lar

35,My Feelings,DiRTY RADiO,"LACE RACE (THE SHOE GAME) Lyrics(Intro + Chorus)
Please don't go I want my shoes
And you have borrowed them
The moment you trip over the laces
And I can't see the logo

Even if I could I'd be upset
With my shoes not by the wall
It reminds me of a Nike bag
My Nike bag. (x2)

(Verse 1)
Dear Morgan
It’s been 3 weeks since you left
And I’ve been getting salty over every unread text

You said you’d leave my shoes by my door a week ago
But I’ve been looking every minute I don’t see them bro

If you needed a pair to keep i could give you my adidas
But not the Air Force 1s that I got in Santa Ria!

You were supposed to borrow them for a day or two
But you went out of town without even giving a clue

It’s okay if you told me you were leaving
Cause then I’d know and we would be agreeing
But now I have to send this rap song to you over a beat
So you can take those shoes off and put them on my feet

You made it way too difficult for old me
And now I’m halfway through this verse and I have to pee

But anyway I hope you get this message and respond
Cause I miss the shoes that I wore for so long

(Chorus)
Please don't go I want my shoes
And you have borrowed them
The moment you trip over the laces
And I can't see the logo

Even if I could I'd be upset
With my shoes not by the wall
It reminds me of a Nike bag
My Nike bag

(Verse 2)
Dear Morgan
It’s been another week
And I’m getting more impatient as we speak

I gave you my shoes cause I thought you were a g
But I think it’s fucked up that your taking them for free
If you wanna talk about it I’m still feeling open
But this exchange is taking way longer than I was hoping

I thought I’d have my shoes back 3 Friday’s ago
But now I’m wearing shitty sketchers out my broken home yo

And it’s all because Mr freeman won’t respond
But buddy can do his acting gigs all day long

If you think it’s funny to play with my feelings
I’ll take those laces and leave you hanging from the ceiling

I’m sorry I just gotta little intense in my room
But I feel the shoes go over me and they loom

Seriously I need a response and if I don’t get one
You won’t be alive next week to go and see your son hun!

(Chorus)
Please don't go I want my shoes (It's been another week)
And you have borrowed them (the shoes)
The moment you trip over the laces, (home, yo)
And I can't see the logo (It's fucked up)

Even if I could I'd be upset
With my shoes not by the wall (from the ceiling)
It reminds me of a Nike bag
My Nike bag
(Verse 3)
Dear Mr I’m too good to give your fuckin shoes back
I hope your ass gets eatin' by a rabid Wolverine pack

I’m so fucking tired of your stupid fucking bullshit
I even let you on the album in some of the skits

Your bitch ass won’t borrow anything from me again
I’ll drag you down the highway and become your kids mother hen

It’s so funny that you never were my friend
Cause you would’ve a made a great fucking girlfriend

And I mean literally fucking like my dick in your anus
But now you get to experience my own in humaneness

You hear that screamin' in the back that’s my shoes!
Cause I had to wear them bitches for a day or two! Woo!

Man I had it up to here with you
I’m pointing so far up broke my cars roof

That’s right I’m in car recording this in my car
And who’s tied up in the back?

McGillis!

Pierre McGillis!

(sniffing)

Morgan Freeman I know your not listening to this but- i didn't- I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it, don't get your lawyers don't-I'm sorry I'm sorry, no FBI!

None of that, understand (screaming)
Why the fuck is there screaming in the background, eminem you dumbass bitch! (screaming)
Why is there screaming
Makes me seem more sus (screaming)

No ambitions
No worries

Do you surf? YES

First time I felt like I knew where I belonged and nothing could stop me from being there. (I was in a different world)

Nothing yet everything felt real
The world was underneath me, around me, above me. (Bro)

I could see everything and everything could see me

And dirty money get washed on royalty statements

Out the garage is how you end up in charge

Everybody sayin' that I'm reckless (Reckless)
I ain't evil but I got some bad intentions, I
Never showed love with my left hand
If you, if you my brother, you don't even gotta question, I
Never was the one to show expression (Yeah)
Do 'em dirty like it's nothin', I'ma deadpan (Deadpan)
With the Zombies, think I got too many dead friends (Dead friends)
Name another crew that we less than, I
[Verse 2: CJ Fly]
Stay above the clouds, I don't get fly
Got the TEC, I stay connected like it's Best Buy
Could have been a Flatbush Zombie 'cause I'm dead nice
If you dap me with your left hand, something ain't right
Because I don't got no time for the fake shit
Niggas funny, start just watchin' when they shapeshift
Shit be blurry when you look at it through they lens
When you think about it, it don't ever make sense (Fly)

[Verse 3: Erick the Architect]
Read the bad vibe when I stepped in (Sheesh)
Never been scared to make suggestions, I
Dressed in all black like the best man (Flee)
Never was a fan of no yes-men, I (No)
Keep my composure with bredren (Brrt)
Until I'm draped in fabric like a reverend (Flee)
So don't feed me no excuses, I'm ahead of them (No)
Yeah, they jealous 'cause they cannot do it better than I

[Chorus: Meechy Darko]
Everybody saying I'm a dead man (Dead man)
This right here's a confession, I
Never show love with my left hand (Left hand)
Never really fuck with no yes-men, I
Think LSD be my best friend
Dick so big, use it as a kickstand
Rarely ever leave the house without my weapon
If you hatin' plot from a distance, die
[Verse 4: Zombie Juice]
Might go around heads like a headband
Big ball, big dog, dead man
Which one of y'all wanna blow down?
Smoke big blunts, size of my dick, ow
It's the fireman, light up here, diamonds shine, I appear
Poodle in my lap, whole Beast clique right here
I'm Jesse on the track, Owens on the mat
All I know is facts, facts, and more facts

[Verse 5: AKTHESAVIOR]
Uh, back to back, we gon' snap
Pass your ho 'round, assist, now check stats
Fuck a pat-down, the grip up in the stash
Shots, a man down, my thirds they never lack
Uh, real G's get money, lay low
Keep a couple shooters, lawyers, payroll, I
Mold your bitch like Play-Doh
Now she specialize in head like Kangol, I

[Verse 6: Kirk Knight]
Lookin' my way, that's a dead end
'Fit same cost as your pension
See my battle scars, Rurouni Kenshin
Gotta trust my gut so I flex it
God-God's at the wheel, like my license suspended (Skrrt)
Coast like the ocean, you drown any second
And fuck your protection, anybody can...

Everybody saying I'm a dead man (Dead man)

Never showed love with my left hand (Left hand)

The police told me I don't give a fuck
My homies told me I don't give a fuck
The OG's told me I don't give a fuck
Yeah, I don't give a fuck, yeah, I don't give a fuck
The government told me I don't give a fuck
The media told me I don't give a fuck
The president told me I don't give a fuck
Yeah, I don't give a fuck, yeah, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 7: Joey Bada$$]
Takin' shots of the Bulleit, got me dead bent
Finger on the trigger, pull it, you a dead man
Not close, need to understand distance
Beast Coast takin' over, it was destined, I
Ain't gotta tell these niggas I'm a legend
Niggas sleep, I ain't even into resting
Couple dead presidents in my left hand
Niggas don't want war with the Badmon, Badmon

[Verse 8: Issa Gold]
Step through, nigga be feelin' like James Bond
Enemies buckin' softer than cotton and creamed corn
Hennessy fill my liver, been drinking a liter
On a killing spree, knocking back thotties like ping pong
Niggas Diddy Kong, follow a leader with weak hearts
Singing silly songs, giving no effort, I leak sauce
Hope you live long, praying for niggas that hate strong
Never hate on, giving out love like Faizon

[Outro: Meechy Darko]
Everybody saying I'm a dead man, I
Never show love with my left hand, I
Everybody saying I'm a dead man, I
Never show love with my left hand29Embed","bet , lit  , flex , stan "

Woo, woo

[Verse 1]
And if the city's skyscrapers rise over this island
Would you be glad to see Manhattan for once?
I knew the dream, it died, JMZ line, Myrtle, and Broadway
But I'd be glad to see Manhattan for once

[Chorus]
Woah-woah, living life in the city
Woah-woah, it will never be pretty, oh, oh
Woah-woah, we can plan if we make it
Woah-woah, we won't let 'em
They won't take it from me, no, oh, oh, woah (2, 3, 4)

[Post-Chorus]
Woo, woo
Woo, woo

[Verse 2]
And if you leave, don't leave me all alone
'Cause I'll be scared, I'll be naked, I'll get cold
And I miss my dad and Cleopatra sitting on a phone
So take me back off these streets and we'll never be apart
Together from the start
Never, never falling back alone
[Chorus]
Living life in the city
Oh-oh, it will never be pretty, oh, oh
Oh-oh, we can plan if we make it
Woah-woah, we won't let 'em
They won't take it from me, no, oh, oh, woah

[Bridge]
And if the sun don't shine on me today
And if the subways flood and bridges break
Will you just lay down and dig your grave?
Or will you rail against your dying day?

Woke up feelin' like I just might run for President
Even if there ain't no precedent, switchin' up the messaging
I'm about to add a little estrogen
Buy my whip by myself, pay my rent by myself
Only exes that I care about are in my fucking chromosomes

Down to the river

You were kicking it back

Who's always chasing your heart?

It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak
[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh

That people can change, but you don't have to leave her

I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice
[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Chorus]
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

[Verse 2]
I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

Um...is that a wig?
I'm confused, is that a weave?
Is that your real hair?
No, you can't touch my fuckin hair! You ain't got no manners!
Oh my God!

[Bridge]
It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it
It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it
It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it
It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it

[Verse 1]
I like the Dominicans who rock they weaves innocent
Shout out the Boricua girls who rock yaki ponytails
Big up to my Africans who braid, many hours spent
They own they own businesses and work while they care for kids
You know I love auntie girls with Sunday best bonnet curls
And love to my Asian chicks who make hair go straight as shit
I love how West Indies do, it's gossip with hair and food
I love how West Indies do, it's gossip with hair and food

[Chorus]
Bundles, bundles, bundles, hit that plug up for the bundles
Beauty shop supply, cashier ringin' up them numbers
Rock my many styles then go natural for the summer
Hair blowin' in the hummer, flip the weave, I am a stunner
Bundles, bundles, bundles, hit that plug up for the bundles
Beauty shop supply, cashier ringin' up them numbers
Rock my many styles then go natural for the summer
Hair blowin' in the hummer, flip the weave, I am a stunner

It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it
It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it
It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it
It's mine, I bought it, it's mine, I bought it

[Verse 2]
Look how I stunt, look how I stunt
Look how I stunt, look how I stunt, in my lace front
10's to the floor, 10's through the door
10's to your face, 5, you a bore
Pick up the pace, spit in your face
Dawson, your creek, Joey to pace
Glue in my weave, Ms. Destiny
Lil Banji, bruise on my knee
Dip on the dip, makin' a trip
Wanna talk slick, I blow them a kiss
Glue in my weave, Ms. Destiny
Lil Banji, bruise on my knee

[Chorus]
Bundles, bundles, bundles, hit that plug up for the bundles
Beauty shop supply, cashier ringin' up them numbers
Rock my many styles then go natural for the summer
Hair blowin' in the hummer, flip the weave, I am a stunner
Bundles, bundles, bundles, hit that plug up for the bundles
Beauty shop supply, cashier ringin' up them numbers
Rock my many styles then go natural for the summer
Hair blowin' in the hummer, flip the weave, I am a stunner
[Outro]
Please do not ask me or any Black or Brown women if our hair is real or not. If it’s a wig, a weave, extensions, braids, don’t fuckin' ask. It’s very rude, it’s extremely personal to be put on the spot like that. How we choose to wear our hair is our personal choice, ok? We bought it, it’s ours, so have some manners and keep your curiosity to yourself1Embed","af  , "

I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave

[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face

I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, ""Nah, love, I'm good, go away""
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it

I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at

Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)

When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

He did the mash, he did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the mash, he did the monster mash

From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

They did the mash, it caught on in a flash
They did the mash, they did the monster mash

The Zombies were having fun, the party had just begun
The guests included Wolfman, Dracula, and his son
The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'

They played the mash, it caught on in a flash

Out from the coffin', Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said
""Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash
The monster mash, it was graveyard smash
It's now the mash, it caught on in a flash
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash

[Verse 5]
Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living this mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you

[Chorus]
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash
The monster mash and do my graveyard smash
Then you can mash, you'll catch on in a flash
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash

I can't wait to show you where I grew up
Walk you 'round the foothills of my town
Probably feel like you've been there before
After hearing all the stories I've been telling you
For six months now

[Verse 2]
We'll probably have to sleep in separate bedrooms
Pack a shirt for church, because we'll go
I'm not trying to scare you off, but
I just thought that we should talk
A few things out before we hit the road

[Chorus]
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Take you fishin', but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

[Verse 3]
My sister's gonna ask a million questions
Say anything she can to turn you red
And when you meet my high school friends
They'll buy you drinks and fill you in
On all the crazy nights I can't outlive
[Chorus]
So if I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Buy you dinner, but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

[Bridge]
Oh
Mmh

[Chorus]
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She feels every heartache I go through
And if my dad sees me cryin'
He'll pour some whiskey over ice and
Tell a lie and say he never really liked you
Oh, if we break up I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine
You'll be breaking more hearts than mine2Embed","bet , bet , bet , af  , lit  , lit  , "

Fear  the m–

Fear the m–
Fear  the man who lives without love
And  the lover who lives without fear
Fear the man who always wants to fight, he's not a talker
Fear  the talker who never wants to fight
He's got no guts
Fear the man who knows he's gonna die
So he cries every night and just denies his life's beauty
And  fear the man who has heaven in his plans
So he gets so complacent that he doesn't call his family
Fear the man who doesn't understand
That there's a million fish in the sea, but
Fear the girl who he really thinks is a different species, she'll rip your heart out

She makes my Ruby Tuesdays taste like Benihanas

My girl moved away, huh
Can't help but think it's something that I say that
Makes her flee my loving arms and smiling face
And moves to a place where nobody even lovingly says her name
You know, it's something that I'd do
Like not text back for a day or two, that says she deserves someone better, but
Every single guy she's ever loved to me sounds really fucking dumb, and stupid
If I become a man
I'll grab your cheek with my unwavering hand and
I'll tell you that I'll never second guess all the lovely love we made
And you don't want kids but let's think about it someday, you know
But you moved away and I
I grabbed you tight and then
I helped you to your car in that shitty parking lot, you know
I really miss you, and I hope that you miss me too
I really hope that you miss me too

She makes my Mondays feel like Fridays
(Give me a break)
She makes my Ruby Tuesdays taste like Benihanas
(Give me a break)
And all I've really wanted

For us to get along

In the more beautiful of films
The hopeless protagonist dies in the end
And whether his eyes stay shut
Or he just stops caring enough
It feels the same

You made my Ruby Tuesdays taste like Benihanas

Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got Molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time

His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized
I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him, ""It's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye""
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

Yeah, I swear this gon' fuck the summer up
Niggas hatin' on me 'cause I'm comin' up
Fuck you all night, we ain't gon' stop until the sun is up
Make you mine for a little
You should let me break your spine just a little
Got your shawty on my pistol, made her empty out the clip
I swear I'm too official, I could never stress a bitch
I done lost a couple soldiers, every day I reminisce
And I could've took his bitch, but her pussy smelled like fish
Me and all my niggas on the ship like marijuana
Only time a nigga hit my phone is when there's drama
Niggas feel a type of way 'cause I do what I wanna
While you was scared of sharks, I was posted with piranhas
I heard that you freaky, maybe you should teach me
I'm afraid to tell you how these other bitches treat me
Don't gotta worry, I'ma pull up when you need me
How my bitch bad is what I wonder like I'm Stevie

I know it's been way too long
I know niggas did you wrong
I said you could call my phone
When you need me, hit me when you need me

I want you to myself, I swear to God I'm greedy
I gotta move a type of way, no, it ain't easy
'Cause at the light is where these niggas tryna leave me
I gotta be cautious, these niggas like to talk shit
I remember when I pulled up on your shorty and she lost it
I was in the trenches, I was moving with them bosses
You was on the benches, you was dwelling over losses
[Chorus]
I know it's been way too long
I know niggas did you wrong
I said you could call my phone
When you need me, hit me when you need me
I know it's been way too long
I know niggas did you wrong
I said you could call my phone
When you need me, hit me when you need me

That lonesome feelin' comes to my door
And the whole world turns
Blue

There's a rundown bar 'cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two, way in the back
Where I sit alone
And think of losin' you

I spend most every night
Beneath the light of a neon moon

There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance
In and out of the beams of a neon moon

I close my eyes and sometimes see
You in the shadows
Of this smoke-filled room

No tellin' how many tears I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied
Tellin' my poor heart
She'll come back someday

Thick thighs, she about 5'5"", or about 5'6""
Pretty tits sittin' high, legs crossed when she sit
Hair was hangin' 'bout an inch, then she cut it off (Cut it off)
Eyebrows on fleek, can't rub it off, no pencil
Trap music in the Benz coupe, with the top down
No nigga, just a shih tzu
Bad bitch, she only smoke blunts with the glass tips
And she buy Chanel bags, just to put her cash in
Chanel thigh-high boots, stash the 380 (Stash the 380)
Money on her mind, she ain't thinkin' 'bout no baby (She ain't thinkin' 'bout no baby)
We used to sing Ashanti
""Baby, baby, ba-baby-y""
Now her mood is, ""Fuck you, pay me"" (Ooh)

47,No Church In The Wild,JAY-Z,"No Church in the Wild Lyrics[Produced By 88 Keys, Kanye West & Mike Dean]
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive?
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pius pious 'cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I'm out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive?
Alright, alright
No church in the wild

[Bridge: The-Dream]
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me in through your encryption
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Coke on her Black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m.
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read, ""No apologies""
The other said, ""Love is cursed by monogamy""
That's something that the pastor don't preach
That's something that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money, we can't keep
But we'll probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive?
Alright, alright

I saw your homie snitching on The First 48
It's the first of the month, don't get murked by the gang
I said, ""Bitch, get in the car with the Backwoods""
Bitches wanna fuck because I rap good
Enemies caught slippin', they get ambushed
Tick, tick, tock, all I see is dollar signs
I was running in the hood but now I run an enterprise
Take a look at the account, everything monetized
Four-fives, AK's, all sides, mob ties
I do it for my mama 'cause we had them hard times
Anybody playing with me, I'ma have to press lines
TEC-9's, I'ma have to flex mines
E's up, I'ma have to rep mines
King Lil G, I'ma see you next time
That's what your bitch said when she had to text mine
But I lied to the bitch, I was high with the bitch
You see it on my stomach, Double 9 in this bitch
You see it on my stomach, Double 9 in this bitch

[Chorus]
No face, no case (Hell nah, it wasn't me)
At the end of the day (At the end of the day)

My dawgs turned up in them correctional facilities
What up to Big Will locked up in the cage
Out in Pleasant Valley and the rest upstate
Lil Ratchet, Trip-A-Lot, YG and Young Daze
I'ma miss you on the real, we the ones that run fades
I told this little bitch all my homies on the mainline
Get naked, I'ma put you on a FaceTime
She dropped it down then she picked it up slow
I suppose she's a pro, she's a real go-getter
Monday night up in Sam's, I was with her
Started throwing bands, I'm a Southside hitter
Really I was faded, but I'm always on some dumb shit
No time, I don't spend it with a bum bitch
I came up last week, went and got a few belts
Louis V's, Fendis, and a couple YSL's

I ain't got no heart, I think I lost it for no reason

She don't even love me, she just want me for my semen
Now she mad at me, I'm just like, ""Shorty, why you tweakin'?""

If she'll be cool, I got no anger in my heart

They only want cash, I never pay for a thot
That's why I'm cookin' up
This music is crack, stand beside the pot
I got my heart locked
I don't give it out 'cause all of these thots is thots
I double up the cup
Freshman year, I was sad and sippin' and stuff
Double the bottoms up
Double the mud until I can't feel my face
Double the shorty's up
I don't want your body, girl, I just want the face

[Intro]
No soy lo que crees, y si te dejas llevar
No me hago responsable si tu corazón no puede recuperar
Tú ere' el bien, yo soy el mal
Y no suelo acostumbrar
Nunca me enseñaron a amar

[Verso 1]
Yo soy de esa' que toca el fin de semana no fallan en salir (En salir)
La que te pichea si te acercas a mí
Dime, ¿qué te hace pensar que yo estaré pa' ti? (Pa' ti)
Dime si son mis cadera' que te ilusionan
Porque yo sé que no perdonan

Mi cuerpo es un arte
Nadie lo toca, soy como la Mona Lisa

Sólo gana quien mi piel eriza
No te enamore', en guerra no muere gente si se avisa
Hago que pequen con mi cadera y sonrisa
Sin querer le hago que gaste los fondos de la Visa

La-La-La que puede, puede, y yo puedo
Baby, si me entrego, aprovéchalo
Todo es discreto, no creo en tercero'
En este caso no eres tú, soy yo

Dressed up all night, there's no one to impress
Standing in lines till I smell like cigarettes
I don’t know why my friends are so obsessed
With staying up till we're sober, wasting money on regrets

'Cause it’s 5 AM and I got work at nine
I'm all alone heading for the exit signs
From the minute that I saw you, I started thinking twice

Shoulders hold a lot of weight

He ain't gon' build like I build
Niggas ain't real like I'm real
S'why they can't feel like I feel
If we get to you try to take from you
You ain't finna kill like I will
You don't even want to live like I live
You ain't gotta gotta get it out here
[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Ima drive and I shoot on a mission
I was raised by the realest of niggas
All they told us was kill all these niggas
We never gone lose if we handle this business
Took a turn on the road to the riches
Left my heart in the curb in the trenches
Everything that I want is expensive
And it came with a lot of conditions
That poison done got in your system
This boy here done shot through the ceiling
At first it's the awkwardest feeling
But fuck it my nigga lets get it
Doin' donuts in something ridiculous
Fuck up traffic with all of my crips
And I gotta be over specific
Just so they notice the difference

It's really my life every verse is medicinal
The shit it got critical
Pain is forever the payback residual
You ain't got war yo I keep on popping my shit that you know you gon' feel in Ru
Ain't got no pressure problem by the beat
This my lil brother call him Body Lee
Went and took a lot of risks
For that money I commit
Streets took all from
Wishing that ain't in vain
I was outdoor though
I was tryna get it
And that's when I get in the game
Bitch you won't get in the way
I put my focus solely in the music
My niggas start feelin' a way
Even if niggas really make it through
Probably gon' deal in the way
I wrap that dope up like some fine China pieces and I ship 'em away
We do this shit everyday
Hussle got rich in the paint
But Hussle got chips in the bank
Hussle ambitious the great
Hussle put fish in a lake
Hussle officially straight
Hussle unlimited faith
Hussle relate if you gon' touch you a safe
Stayed down through the hard times
Frontline when it was yard time
Self-made pushing hard lines
Tryna tell you niggas that it's our time

It's not the energy reeling
Nor the lines in your face
Nor the clouds on the ceiling
Nor the clouds in space
It's not the phone on the table
Nor the bed in the earth
Nor the bed in the stable
Nor your stable words
It's not the formless being
Nor the cry in the air
Nor the boy I'm seeing
With her long black hair
It's not the open weaving
Nor the furnace glow
Nor the blood of you bleeding
As you try to let go

There ain't nothin' out here but dogs in the yard
And a couple John Deeres, some fallin' down barns
Yeah, it's pretty damn clear like lightning in a jar
If you passed it on the interstate, I bet you'd say
There ain't nothin' out here, there ain't a skyline
If you seen it from a leer jet, I bet you'd ask why
Anybody down there would wanna live and die
Somewhere you gotta be lost to go, but they don't know

[Chorus: HARDY]
We alright with that out-of-touch label
Turn that dirt into what's on the table
And we don't need no shiny good time
We're fine with a county line kinda cold beer
Keep those dust-covered, rusted trucks running
You kissed on the bus, now you're raising up youngins
All you're gonna find windin' through the country
Is some middle-of-nowhere folks
Makin' somethin' outta nothin' out here

[Verse 2: Thomas Rhett]
Yeah, it ain't nothin' out here to wake up with the sun
Throw your get-'er-done in gear, don't quit until it's done
Thank the man upstairs that gave you what you got
May not look like a lot outside lookin' in
Oh, but then again

We alright with that out-of-touch label
Turn that dirt into what's on the table

Weak knees in a CVS
Door locked in the bathroom

Never thought that they'd be

A couple American babies raisin' one up their self

Burnin' into a two beer buzz
Three beers turns into five and six
Then a love drunk kiss in the back of that truck
Just like that, everything rearranges
Life changes out of the blue
It's just a Bud Light, but ain't it funny
What one beer can turn into?

Now the world don't spin without 'em (Hey, yeah)

And I wanna chase every high with you
Count every rip in these old jeans

Don't tell me this is all for nothin'
I can only tell you one thing
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere
I see everything you can be
I see the beauty that you can't see
On the nights you feel outnumbered
Baby, I'll be out there somewhere

I could've showed you all the scars at the start
But that was always the most difficult part
See, I'm in love with how your soul's a mix of chaos and art
And how you never try to keep 'em apart (Yeah)
I wrote some words and then I stared at my feet
Became a coward when I needed to speak
I guess love took on a different kind of meaning for me
So when I go, just know it kills me to leave

To all the stars that light the road
Don't ever leave that girl so cold
Never let me down, just lead me home

But there's beauty here that's yet to depart
There's still a song inside the halls in the dark (Halls in the dark)
I'll come for you if you just stay where you are
And I'll always hold your hand in the car (Hand in the car)
There'll be days when it's difficult
But I ask you to never leave behind the reciprocal, we're past that
Love is not designed for the cynical
So we have that (We have that)
We can have that

51,Overthinker,INZO,"Overthinker Lyrics[Spoken Word: Alan Watts]
A person who thinks all the time
Has nothing to think about except thoughts
So, he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions
By thoughts I mean specifically, chatter in the skull
Perpetual and compulsive repetition of words, of reckoning and calculating
I'm not saying that thinking is bad
Like everything else, it's useful in moderation
A good servant, but a bad master
And all so-called civilized peoples
Have increasingly become crazy and self-destructive
Because through excessive thinking they have lost touch with reality
That's to say
We confuse signs
With the real world

[Drop]
This is the beginning of meditation

Most of us would have rather money than tangible wealth
And a great occasion is somehow spoiled for us unless photographed
And to read about it the next day in the newspaper
Is oddly more fun for us than the original event
This is a disaster
For as a result of confusing the real world of nature with mere signs
We are destroying nature
We are so tied up in our minds that we've lost our senses
Time to wake up
What is reality?
Obviously, no one can say
Because it isn't words
It isn't material, that's just an idea
Reality is-
[Drop]
The point cannot be explained in words

I'm not trying to put you down
It's an expression of you as you are
One must live...
We need to survive, to go on
We must go on18Embed","lit  , lit  , lit  , lit  , "

With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls counting on me to be there like missing rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember?

23 and going through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not saying I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets

Ayy, she met me, let me fuck in the shower
I wrote my number in the mist on the mirror
I'm not the type to tell my homies about ya
You're not the type to hold me down through the year

[Chorus: Dominic Fike]
I'll be your baby doll and your bodyguard if you tell me to
I'll try to make it all not as hard if you let me through

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I ain't sign up for no bullshit
I told my baby that I'm bulletproof
Hands made me take two sips
All things I couldn't do
The cops come, then we dip, baby
Back when we was just friends, baby
Shit, man, you was just a baby
And I turned on you like Mother Nature
Try to think about the blueprint
All the shit that you told me not to do
Was breaking it worth it in the end
If I'm just a vision you come to?

[Pre-Chorus: Joba, & bearface]
It's all peaches and cream
If you left your love I'll be right
[Chorus: Dominic Fike]
I'll be your baby doll and your bodyguard if you tell me to
I'll try to make it all not as hard if you let me through

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I ain't tryna get the roof bent
Back then when I would ride with you
Short trips doing backflips
Mesmerized me, led me to the truth
Atlanta, we was kids, baby
Special moments with my friends, baby
Sippin' on some fuckin' gin, baby
And you wonder why we ain't win, baby
This year I ain't takin' no pics
I'm tryna get with the motion
I'm tryna get a promotion
Window shoppin' 'til they closin'

[Pre-Chorus: Joba, & bearface]
It's all peaches and cream
If you left your love I'll be right

[Chorus: Dominic Fike]
I'll be your baby doll and your bodyguard if you tell me to
I'll try to make it all not as hard if you let me through

Pick up the phone when you alone

Show me some love, kisses and hugs
No, I never had an issue
Go to the club with your boys, baby, I
Never wanted you to stay too long
Just wanted you to show me off

[Verse 1]
I wake up every morning with my head up in a daze
I'm not sure if I should say this, fuck, I'll say it anyway
Everybody tries to tell me that I'm goin' through a phase
I don't know if it's a phase, I just wanna feel okay, yeah
I battle with depression, but the question still remains
Is this post-traumatic stressin' or am I suppressin' rage?
And my doctor tries to tell me that I'm going through a phase
Yeah, it's not a fuckin' phase, I just wanna feel okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, yeah, I struggle with this bullshit every day
And it's probably 'cause my demons simultaneously rage
It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me

'Cause I'm about to break down
I'm searchin' for a way out
I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
I'm a popular, popular monster
I break down
Falling into love now
With falling apart
I'm a popular, popular monster
[Verse 2]
I think I'm going nowhere like a rat trapped in a maze
Every wall that I knock down is just a wall that I'll replace
I'm in a race against myself, I try to keep a steady pace
How the fuck will I escape if I never close my case?
Oh my God, I keep on stressin', every second that I waste
Is another second sooner to a blessing I won't take
But my therapist will tell me that I'm going through a stage
Yeah, it's not a fucking stage, I just wanna feel okay

Okay, motherfucker, now you got my attention
I need to change a couple things 'cause somethin' is missing
And what if I were to lie? Tell you everything is fine
Every single fucking day I get closer to the grave
I am terrified, I fell asleep at the wheel again
Crashed my car just to feel again
It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me

I've never been one to ask for help
If I need a mountain moved, I move it myself
I ain't the church pew regular, twice on Sunday
Quote you the scripture kind
I'm far from a preacher
But I'm a believer

[Chorus 1]
'Cause every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you

[Verse 2]
For someone to love me like you do
Graceful eyes to see me through
A smile that steals me, a heart that heals me
A touch that kills me too
And baby, you're perfect, I guess the good Lord heard it

[Chorus 1]
'Cause every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you

Every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every tail light fade in the goodbye rain
Girl, even today, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you

Cut him off 'cause he prayed for the flop

There's so much more that your eyes can't see

In hopes that the cool kids will ask me to stay

Just standing on the side line waiting for a standing ovation

You know I need you, baby
So much on my mind, I ain't even really sleepin' lately
I said some things I didn't mean, I know I did too much
What's love if we can't get into it, turn around and make up?
You kept it solid from beginning, baby, you my day one
You caught me in a lie, looked back up at you like I'm dumb
I had to make you my girl, you ain't afraid to speak up
No matter where we are, who it is, you still gon' tee up
Go through withdrawals when we apart, get back together, re-up
You stayed ten toes down, now you can kick your feet up
I had to boss you up, I had to level up myself
I did some growin' up, I'm doin' better for myself
But I still need you

You know you wouldn't last in no prison
You told me straight up you ain't doin' no bid for me, uh
The Lord, He blessed you with common sense
Too many good b****** behind the fence
For lyin' to feds for n***** that climb in bed with thotties
If I ever catch me a body, I'll make you a promise, you won't know about it
I can't get you caught up in messes I made
Love you forever
When we turn like 50, I'm still gonna have all of your messages saved
Purple emojis with horns on it

In fact, it's a Heaven-sent thing
Black angel with the regular name
F*** strangers, I could never contain my passion for you
I'm grabbin' on you in public, I know that you love it

No frontin', I keep it one hunnit

10,Queen of Mean,Sarah Jeffery,"Queen of Mean Lyrics[Intro]
I'm so tired of pretending
Where's my happy ending?

[Verse 1]
I followed all the rules
I drew inside the lines
I never asked for anything that wasn't mine
I waited patiently for my time
But when it finally came
He called her name
And now I feel this overwhelming pain
I mean it's in my veins
I mean it's in my brain
My thoughts are running in a circle like a toy train
I'm kinda like a perfect picture with a broken frame
I know exactly who to blame

[Chorus]
I never thought of myself as mean
I always thought that I'd be the queen
And there's no in between
'Cause if I can't have that
Then I would be the leader of the dark
And the bad
Now there's a devil on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And it's calling me the queen
[Verse 2]
Being nice was my pastime
But I've been hurt for the last time
And I won't ever let another person take advantage of me
The anger burns my skin, third-degree
Now my blood's boiling hotter than a fiery sea
There's nobody getting close to me
They're gonna bow to the Evil Queen
Your nightmare's my dream
Just wait until they fall to my wicked schemes

[Chorus]
I never thought of myself as mean
I always thought that I'd be the queen
And there's no in between
'Cause if I can't have that
Then I would be the leader of the dark
And the bad
Now there's a devil on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
(Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean

[Verse 3]
Something's pulling me
It's so magnetic
My body is moving
Unsure where I'm headed
All of my senses have left me defenseless
This darkness around me
Is promising vengeance
The price that I'm willing to pay is expensive
There's nothing to lose
When you're lonely and friendless
So my only interest is showing this princess
That I am the queen
And my reign will be endless (Endless)
[Bridge]
I want what I deserve
I want to rule the world
Sit back and watch them learn
It's finally my turn

[Chorus]
If they want a villain for a queen
I'm gonna be one like they've never seen
I'll show them what it means
Now that I am that
I will be the ruler of the dark and the bad
'Cause the devil's on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
(Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)

You're trippin' off of tryptophan and tripped a fan in Switzerland
Just for askin' to autograph a picture
Then ripped it in half and whipped it at him
And kicked his ass all the way back to Michigan
But no matter how many rounds or if I get knocked down

40,Best Part,H.E.R.,"Rap Up 2020 Lyrics[Intro]
Definitely did take a long time
2020 been a sad year
Wasn't gon' even do this
But I figured y'all needed me after everything that been goin' on
The homie Great John on the beat, by the way
Don't Come Outside, Volume 3 out now
Great John on the beat, by the way

[Verse 1]
I'm a fan Heavenly Father but right now I'm booing you
What did Kobe, Gigi and them other passengers do to you? (What they do?)
My condolences at this time is all I could offer
Kobe got me out here spendin' more time with my daughter (He do)
Takin' Kobe from us had the whole world stressed
You coulda took a average player, not one of the best
Somebody like Lamar Odom or Delonte West (Ah)
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin', we woulda missed them less (God bless)
I'm convinced God don't got the answers
First you take the Black Mamba from us, then the Black Panther (Damn)
Fuck 2020, this whole year started off wack
Best part of the year's here and that's hearin' me rap (You want it)
Hearin' me rap that straight up, 2020's a dub, nigga
Atlanta the only spot that ain't shut down they clubs, nigga (Lord)
Pandemic got niggas eatin' like Action Bronson
They ain't scared of catchin' the corona like Magic Johnson (You did)
Is it real? Is it fake? I don't know, I know shit sad
People dyin' from it off some shit that they been had
They said Trump had it but I think he was fakin' it
They got a vaccine now but I still ain't takin' it (God)
We all saw that nurse who passed out from that shit
Live on TV, miss me with that funny shit
I don't trust the government, they chasin' that fuckin' bag
Whole coronavirus shit feel like a money grab
They tryna get paid, virus is man-made
They actin' like this shit worser than cancer and AIDS (Than cancer)
Kids can't go to school, people can't go to work
Strip clubs closed, bitches ain't got nowhere to twerk (Nah)
Now they lookin' for sponsors, so I'm tellin' chicks, ""I'm broke""
That was prop money on the 'Gram, Kodak Black joke (I ain't got it)
I'm not a big fan of this next line I wrote
I hate the fact I gotta say, ""Rest in peace to Pop Smoke"" (Damn)
The good die young, it really wasn't his time
Him bein' dead and Tekashi still livin' is a crime
God, you gotta do better, you been fuckin' up lately
Bro, all I hear is Pop Smoke when I turn on my radio (Woo)
They play Pop so much it feel like he still here
Got us woo walkin', wearin' Dior just to be clear (Facts)
COVID-19 shit got Fred The Godson
One of the few emcees you could really get bars from
He represented real rap for real New Yorkers
My condolences to your wife and your two daughters
Kings killin' kings and it's bein' filmed on camera
Hated seein' niggas killing King Von in Atlanta (Wack)
Megan sayin' Tory shot her, he sayin' she cappin'
Them people that was in the truck with them told me what happened (They told me)
He wanted that wet-ass pussy, she ain't give him none
She hurt Tory ego and that's when he pulled out a gun
Then she tried to leave and that's when he start clappin'
I made that whole shit up but that sound like what really happened (Haha)
If he really did shoot her, that was some lame shit
She snitchin' now but she a girl so it ain't the same shit (Yeah)
We ain't lookin' at her like how we look at 6ix9ine
Lookin' at Tory like he played himself, fuck was on his mind? (What up?)
That bullet ain't faze her, her leg ain't even hurtin'
A week after she got shot, Meg was back twerkin' (Body-ody-ody-ody)
Been a crazy year, wouldn't you say?
Found out Jada Pinkett gave Will Smith pussy away (She did what?)
Tried to call it an entanglement so it don't sound like nothin'
No, it's called cheatin', Jada, you and August was fuckin' (God)
Got Will Smith out here lookin' like a whole sucker
Wonder how Jaden and Willow feel about they mother (Damn)
Fuck that Red Table, let's discuss some other shit
I wonder if Will asked Jada, did she suck his dick? (Woah)
Now he questionin' how you and 'Pac was out here movin'
He was lookin' stressed at the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air reunion (He was)
Actin' like he give a fuck 'bout how Aunt Viv feel
He probably think that she difficult to work with still (Haha, sheesh)
Cardi B filed for divorce
You know how her and Offset do, they back together, of course (Stop playin')
Dr. Dre wife tried to get two mill' a month
I know Dre happy that she signed that prenup
Dre my nigga, his business all in the street (All in the street)
How much of that man money she tryna keep?
She wasn't with him in the studio makin' them beats
Bitch, you wasn't with me in the studio makin' them beats (Woo)
Put your pussy lips on live, I'll give ya a thousand dollars
Boosie was bein' too thirsty, I'm just bein' honest (He was)
If doin' too much was a person
They deleted his account, now his shit ain't workin' (Damn)
Instagram missin' you, the Internet fuck with you
In that interview with Mike Tyson, you looked uncomfortable
For talkin' 'bout Dwyane Wade's son, he was pressin' you
He was askin' you if you was gay, he was disrespectin' you
Never seen Boosie Badazz talkin' so polite (Never)
He ain't want no smoke with that nigga Iron Mike (Uh-uh)
Woulda looked like Nate Robinson if Mike Tyson hit him
Rest in peace to the homie Mo3 who there with him (Damn)
Couple days after Mo3 died, Boosie got shot
Them Dallas niggas thought Boosie was tryna spin the block (Skrrt)
That nigga Akon was out here trippin'
Tryna explain and justify 6ix9ine snitchin'
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, we felt that
He tried to remix that old-ass record with a rat (You played yourself)
All these rappers gettin' shot, not one bullet hit Tekashi
They really let that nigga out early and kept Bobby (Free Rowdy)
[Chorus]
Y'all couldn't wait for this shit to drop
I really entertain y'all with all this shit I pop (I do, right?)
Every year 'round the same time, y'all check for me (Ah)
They like how I disrespect niggas respectfully (True)
Y'all heard what happened, y'all know what happened
But y'all don't care (Y'all don't care)
Y'all still want me to talk about this shit every year (Every year)
Crazy, crazy, shit crazy (I just don't wanna stop, crazy)
Crazy, crazy, shit crazy

[Verse 2]
Jeezy shouldn't have battled Gucci
Knowin' he was gon' rap about killin' his homie Pookie (Woo)
I get it but fuck all that culture shit
Disrespect my dead homie, I'm poppin' off, battle over with
Try to shoot the nigga up, cut the nigga, at least fuckin' fight
Niggas talk about smokin' on Pookie Loc tonight (Facts)
One of the most disrespectful things that I ever seen
Gucci ignorant but remind me of me when I was seventeen (He do)
Niggas on the streets sayin', ""Jeezy lost it""
That was some sucker shit, he movin' too corporate (Damn)
I ain't with that cool shit, I'm with that ra-ra
JAY-Z wouldn't battle Nas if Nas killed Ty Ty (He wouldn't)
Pookie rollin' over in his grave, you got him hurt
Watchin' you perform with the nigga that put him in the dirt
He prolly got some other issues, leave Jeezy alone
Big Meech brother Southwest T just came home
Let's talk about some shit that got the people upset
Cops that killed Breonna Taylor ain't get arrested yet
Attorney General Daniel Cameron fucked us all up
Them cops that killed Breonna got charged with shootin' the wall up
I repeat, Daniel Cameron is a sell-out
He in a sunken place, like that movie, can't Get Out
Defund the police, Obama said he don't believe in that
In the country where you can't even jog while bein' black (I'm disappointed)
Rest in peace to Ahmaud Arbery
An ex-cop killed him thinkin' he committed a robbery
George Floyd gettin' murdered was on the Internet
For eight minutes straight that cop had his knee on his neck
The whole world came together and protested
They ain't convict him yet but at least they did get arrested (Woo)
Unity was real, government start gettin' scared
We was marchin' like the coronavirus disappeared
White people was out here screamin', ""Black Lives Matter""
And honestly I think that was makin' the police madder (They scared)
And all Donald Trump did was talk about Louis
Nothin' 'bout the knee on the neck and police shootings
He encouraged the police violence
Trump dumbass told us, ""Take Lysol for the virus""
Said it was goin' away, of course he lyin'
Over three hundred thousand Americans done died
Lil Wayne and Lil Pump jumped on Trump dick
Now look, now they look stupid for doin' that dumb shit (They do)
And he lost the election, I know he embarrassed
He know he ain't lose to Joe, he lost to Kamala Harris
Joe Biden knew what he was doin' when he picked her
He knew we was comin' out to vote for a Black sister (We did)
Trump had to go but Joe Biden need to get smacked
For tellin' us if we don't vote for him, we ain't Black
I still think you racist and that's my problem with you
We only voted for you 'cause you got Kamala with you
And I'm not a fan of both of y'all reputations
You and Kamala responsible for mass incarcerations
Y'all the reason they won't leave us alone
The best news we got all year was Rowdy comin' home
It was dope seein' him on Instagram bein' celebrated
He a real one, he ain't fold when he got interrogated
Pharrell was on Drink Champs talkin' some stupid shit
Just 'cause you pay taxes don't make it cool to snitch
I hear about certain shit that make my ass smile
R. Kelly got beat up in jail, good for that pedophile
I'ma miss Donald Trump, can't front, he was funny
Obama gave us trap phones, Trump gave us re-up money
He was makin' y'all laugh too, I'm just remindin' you
He was out here callin' the coronavirus the China flu (It comes from China)
I appreciated that he ain't bite his tongue
If that second stimulus check had came, he mighta won (He mighta)
That unemployment money had y'all feelin' like Big Meech
You was ballin' with that extra six hundred dollars a week (Y'all was)
Bitch, that was better than your regular job
Certain chicks couldn't pay bills unless head was involved
Your OnlyFans page really wasn't poppin' for real
Now you know how a local mixtape rap nigga feel
Them SBA loans had niggas out here in all kinda shit
They was just bums, now they pullin' up with designer shit (Oh, you serious?)
I'ma miss fake beefin' with Casanova
I was about to get on him for fuckin' with Fashion Nova
He prolly like, ""This nigga Murda always gotta play""
I wish he woulda turned himself in after the holidays
Hope I made him laugh while he fightin' for his freedom
Know it's free my nigga Casanova 'til they free him (Oh yeah)
(Is it okay if I call her one?) Who said that shit?
That was Snoop callin' Gayle King a funky dog head bitch
For goin' at Kobe with no consideration
On how his family was feelin' knowin' the situation
LeBron got his fourth ring, you gotta respect his shit
He was tired of hearin' y'all talkin' all that Kawhi Leonard shit
He gon' repeat this year, the Lakers look like a bigger threat
L.A. needed that, they ain't even get over Nipsey yet
That corona had niggas ballin' in a bubble
For James Harden, Houston already got rid of Russell
Y'all be disrespectin' Westbrook, that shit gotta stop
I ain't gon' lie, though, that nigga really don't got no jumpshot (Haha)
Lou Williams left the bubble to go to Magic City for chicken wings
He ain't go there for no ass and titties
Kawhi Leonard and Paul George blew a three-one lead
And Giannis ain't deserve to be the MVP of the league
He get in the playoffs and he look like JaVale McGee
I know that's disrespectful but I mean that respectfully
Brooklyn is litty with KD and Kyrie
Madison Square Garden disrespectin' Spike Lee ('Cause no one told me)
Deontay Wilder lost his first fight
He got beat up by Tyson, I ain't talkin' 'bout Mike
Oh, the Tyson that he got beat up by was white (Was white)
(To this day) Can't believe he got beat up that night
Adrien Broner was on the ""Catch Me Outside"" girl page
In her DM, oh, he ain't know she was underage (What?)
Floyd Mayweather struggled saying ""epidemic""
Everyday Struggle got canceled, they fired Akademiks
We saw Wack 100 knockin' out a racist cracker
They tried to jump him like they ain't know Black Lives Matter (Haha)
Supposedly Kanye worth around three bill'
But that ain't stoppin' him from tweetin' about how he feel
He been tryna leave Kim since he met up with Meek Mill
He think Drake fucked her too and him and JAY don't speak still
Y'all couldn't wait for this time to come
Y'all already know that that nigga Murda don't bite his tongue (I don't)
You forgot about Nick Gordon, no, I didn't
So what? He dead, we ain't care about him when he was livin'
Always blamed him for Bobbi Kristina dyin'
So to act like I care that he dead, I'd be lyin'
My newborn was born on Valentine's Day
That's the best gift a nigga coulda got, what more could I say?
Nicki had a baby, congratulations
Her husband and Meek almost got in an altercation
They shoulda just got it on, like, nobody get the blicky
It woulda been funny watchin' them fightin' over Nicki
Cardi B and Megan had conservatives tryna ban 'em
For that wet-ass pussy record, then it became an anthem
[Chorus]
Y'all couldn't wait for this shit to drop
I really entertain y'all with all this shit I pop (I do)
Every year 'round the same time, y'all check for me (Uh-huh)
They like how I disrespect niggas respectfully (Haha)
Y'all heard what happened, y'all know what happened
But y'all don't care (Yeah)
Y'all still want me to talk about this shit every year (Okay)
Crazy, crazy, shit crazy (Shit crazy)
Crazy, crazy, shit crazy (Woah, woah, woah, woah, shit crazy)
It's Great John beats, baby
Great John on the beat, by the way

[Verse 3]
I don't care if it still stink, I'ma leave her alone
Even though she out here wishin' R. Kelly was home (Damn)
Nick Cannon got fired for talkin' 'bout white people, he was Wild N Out
He forgot he work for white people
Scottie Pippen ex-wife still doin' ho shit
Jeremih almost died fuckin' around with that COVID
Ashanti got it too, they put the battle on hold
With O.T. Genasis arch-nemesis Keyshia Cole
Ashanti gon' win that battle, my girl love her
Irv Gotti was corny for tellin' Wendy he fucked her (He was)
Michael B. Jordan fuckin' Lori Harvey
I was on MSNBC with Ari (Woah)
Talkin' 'bout Trump gettin' impeached
We was politickin', look how far the Rap Up done reached
The first debate with Trump and Joe Biden was comedy
That's when I realized we gon' be fucked either way, honestly
Oprah and Gayle King still don't realize why we upset
We realize they ain't talk about Harvey Weinstein yet
Fuck whoever not with us, nigga, that's how I play
Rest in peace to that nigga Deebo from Friday
I hate 2020, this whole year had a nigga tight
Can't believe I'm sayin' rest in peace to my nigga Light
Dave East, where you at, homie? I hope you listenin'
Told my nigga Light to tell Shooter you fuckin' missin' him
Condolences to your fam' and your niggas in Queensbridge
We was gon' shoot a video for the record we did
Can't believe I'm tellin' my nigga Hank, ""Rest in peace""
Believe me when I tell you that this year was stressin' me (It was)
This year I really wasn't even gon' do this shit
Wasn't in the mood to laugh and joke about no stupid shit (Wasn't)
Then niggas just kept doin' stupid shit
Then I saw that Snoop Dogg post, like, I gotta do this shit (Okay)
Flex lost weight but he ain't do it the hard way
That nigga cheated, he went and got lipo' like Kanye
So many rappers got shot, I could be here forever
Joey Dollas got hit up, I hope he get better (Damn)
The Verzuz battles durin' quarantine was savin' us
Real talk, I wrote this shit while I was Jada drunk (I did)
Salute to Timbaland and Swizz Beatz
But a few battles y'all put together put us to sleep
Lil Baby got money so it's cool if he like to trick
It wasn't sixteen bands, though, bitch, it was only six
For kids in Philly, Meek do plenty of shit
How you gon' give them kids from Atlanta a $20 to split?
How nobody ain't whip Akademik ass yet?
On Clubhouse, Meek told him he got his address (Ha)
Zimmermann still livin', we should all be ashamed
50 got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame
JAY-Z distributin' marijuana
This nigga A$AP Rocky fuckin' on Rihanna (Woah)
Everybody masked up, shit is the new normal
The feds is on Clubhouse, don't say I didn't warn you
Y'all wanted twenty minutes, I was gon' really try it
But I was in that motherfuckin' booth gettin' tired
Like LeBron said, I want my damn respect
R.I.P. to the homie Alex Trebek
Shit crazy, nigga, this year was hard as hell
Icons died, rest in peace to Andre Harrell
Without him it wouldn't have been no Diddy (Wouldn't have)
So that mean it probably wouldn't have been no Biggie (Facts)
You see how important he was? So that shit hit me
I almost forgot to mention, you my nigga, forgive me
Fuck 2020, I'm done, it's a wrap here
I ain't doin' this shit no more, this is my last year2Embed","bet , bet , bet , af  , af  , af  , af  , thirsty  , lit  , lit  , lit  , lit  , gucci  , gucci  , extra  , cap  , mood , flex , "

Si tú me das un brake, yo te voy a hacer un cuento
¿Quieres conocer a Junito? Yo te lo presento (Ma-)

I never thought it’d be this

Is this what they call the abyss?
I fought and clawed for an inch
Turned into miracle mile
I can recall when your lips
Used to contort into smiles
Bright as the sun that’s drawn an eclipse
I haven’t seen light in awhile
Hasn’t been bright in awhile

[Verse 1: Bas]
Even days when you mad at me (Mad at me...)
You the one to give me clarity (Clarity...)
A testament to your character (Character...)
On your birthday you told me to donate money to charity
You are made of sincerity ('cerity...)
And got cake like Sara Lee
You tether me when my stress start burying me
You are the one to take care of me
I’m so gone, that conclusion foregone that confuse you
I'm weary of war zones, this tour long
I’m ready to go home, I’m ready for your bed
Can you comb my hair out so it don’t dread?
I just want my head rubbed
I don’t want a mixtape
I just want the best of
I just wanna get grub, from our spot again
But do the odds work in our favor?
Stay down, escape town
Head low and face down
Like a kenneled greyhound
Doing God’s work in the devil's playground

Risk
I never thought it’d be this
I’m jumpin' out of your arms
I land and fall in a pit
Is this what they call the abyss?
I fought and clawed for an inch
Turned into miracle mile

Used to contort into smiles
Bright as the sun that’s drawn an eclipse
I haven’t seen light in awhile
Hasn’t been bright in awhile

Wish you picked up all my calls
I been goin' through withdrawals
Tryin' to take the edge off, I need novacane
I been tryin' to stand tall
I hope that you stand wit' me
You know all the greats fall, shit is all the same
Hot as napalm
Next day come the rain, gotta stay calm
Press play, put my heart in all of these songs
Display all of these wrongs, yeah, a part of me is gone
You are a gift in itself
A measure of wealth
The meaning of selfless
I place you over the shelf and higher than pedestals
Over the belt that straddle the waist on Orion’s constellation Observation of you
Here come the truth
I’m most overdue
I’m stuck over you
I’ve gone under
Living proof of God's wonders
[Chorus: Bas]
Risk
I never thought it’d be this
I’m jumpin' out of your arms
I land and fall in a pit
Is this what they call the abyss?
I fought and clawed for an inch

Cuttin' the page
Things are looking up
That time is out of my range
One drink's what lead to the change
Out on my own
Kicked out of the show
I'll take what's mine and I'll go
It's just like my own brothers used to say

[Chorus]
There's somethin' wrong with this world
I feel it coming on
And contradictions take their toll
Is that where we went wrong?
And somethin' struck me
It struck me deep
It knocked me to my knees
Roddy, step on back from me (Ah)

[Verse 2]
So man in the mirror
Make another home here
You're put together but clear
You're lackin' substance not fear
So come right inside
Welcome to my new life
Separation intwined
And I can't keep it straight inside my head
[Chorus]
There's something wrong with this world
I feel it coming on
And contradictions take their toll
Is that where we went wrong?
And something struck me
It struck me deep
It knocked me to my knees

Sometimes I dream about going back
Keeping all the things I left behind
But now I know you can’t change the past

Faster than it ever has before

Looking at old pictures on the floor
But I hear everything telling me
""You don’t have the time, you gotta go""

Go ahead and park after dark
Fallen star, I'm your one call away
Motel halls, neon walls
When night falls, I am your escape

[Pre-Chorus]
When you lay alone, I ache
Something I wanted to feel

[Chorus]
If you’ve been waitin' for fallin' in love
Babe, you don’t have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need

[Verse 2]
Not anyone, you're the one
More than fun, you're the sanctuary
'Cause what you want is what I want
Sincerity

[Pre-Chorus]
Souls that dream alone lie awake
I’ll give you somethin’ so real
[Chorus]
If you've been waitin’ for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I’ve been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need

'Cause you never know
Just how long our lives will be

We were low, we were high, Jekyll, Hyde
I'll still stay by your side
You know I tried, and tried, and tried, and tried, and tried
I was wrong, you was right, justified, I was playing with fire
What a divide, divide, divide, divide, divide

Good God, these niggas is crazy
Just fight the feeling, it's all we do

What if I told you...

But I couldn't mold you

But I'm on my own two now, I've grown to know
A lotta shit that I didn't before
My heart in your grip don't let my shit slip on the floor
I followed your drip and finally see where you goin'
I try to remember
But then I remember that you got a temper, and I got no filter

Can we please take it easy?
Let's just act like adults

Probably need to grow up and away

Got a skinny thong like a tightrope

Coupe 150, call it Kyro

[Verse 1]
If she left with me, she the right ho
Man, she ridin' me like a BMX
Man, she said the D is for Dyno
I got two horns like a rhino

But I bought a mansion with a slide door
Yes, I opened up the slide door
So you can hear her hit the high note

Hit her once, now she dismissed
Can't fuck her sister, make her lick dick
Forty-orty make my hip thick
When I see an opp, make the clip hit

Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
[Verse 2]
Saturday nights, light gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowing what you gotta do
You've got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose

I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep

Don't you want a pal?

Your daddy should be leavin'
And you should stick around

(spoken)
And kill him!

What?

Nothing.

So, Lydia, don't end yourself
Defend yourself
Daddy is the one you should maim
Together we'll exterminate, assassinate

[LYDIA]
No!
[BETELGEUSE]
The finer points can wait
But first you gotta say my name!

Go ahead and jump but that won't stop him
Here you got a solid plan B option
I can bring your daddy so much pain
All you gotta do is say my name

Girl, just say it three times in a row
And you won't believe how far I'll go
I'm on the bench, but Coach—
Just put me in the game
All you gotta do is say my name

[LYDIA, spoken]
I don't know your name.

I know, I went a little hard on the sell
But we're BF-F-F-F's forever!

We don't need that demon
The three of us alone can wreck dad's evening
Together we can make a grown man weep
Guys, I got a dinner date to keep

[ADAM, spoken]
Okay, so what's the plan?

[LYDIA (ADAM & BARBARA)]
Teach dad a lesson
He's gonna freak when we possess him
So, he wants the perfect daughter
I'll lead that lamb to slaughter
Yeah, I got game!
I'm gonna make him say my name
(Make him say your name)
I'll make him say my name

I'll make him say my name

Testin' your gun inside of the backyard, let it hit, get your aim up

And the way we gon' dump at the boy with the stick, I'ma finish him off with a four nickel

The 21st night of September?

Shoot up the spot and make him move out
Soon as he move, I find his house

Put him on a tee, now he up in the sky

Words can stab as deep as night
And cut like a razored thorn
Bitter air and the winds of spite
Like the cold of winter's scorn
Leaves may fall on sleeping ground
But the wind sweeps them away
Like hurt lovers in the final round
What once was is now decayed

Just dancin' in the sun
Please don't turn around and leave

Compromise is made out of peace
But history's made out of violence
After the war of the words has ceased
All that's left is the deafenin' silence

You done me wrong, so here's your song
Now sing along, baby

[Intro]
Ea

[Verso 1]
Me la navego en todos lados, siempre con ojos tumbados
En la bola destacado, siempre piso con cuidado
Soy alegre y desatado, la vagancia me ha gustado
Estoy bien relacionado y de espantos bien curado
No se metan con el diablo que pueden salir quemado'
Siempre pensando positivo y evito lo negativo
Yo sé muy bien lo que digo, no suelo ser conflictivo
Pero traigo una Beretta pa’l que se pase de vivo
Pónganse trucha, cabrones, nunca se metan conmigo
Si tienen algún problema, con gusto aquí lo recibo
Yo no ando con chingaderas ni tampoco de manguera
Los pies firmes en la tierra, somos de buena madera
Mi madre es mi vida entera y listo estoy pa' lo que venga
Mi familia tendrá todo hasta el día en que yo me muera
Perdón a mis jefecitos por ser un dolor de muelas, ¡ea!

[Puente Instrumental]

[Verso 2]
Malas experiencias he pasado, pero nunca le he sacado
Recuerdo cuando perreaba pa' levantar un centavo
Pero hoy me he superado, pues, bien duro he trabajado
Nunca me di por vencido hasta que diera vuelta el dado
Hoy tengo lo que yo quiero, pero no ando de elevado
Hoy sé quién está conmigo y quién es el convenenciero
Te sobran las amistades cuando saben que hay dinero
Y te lloverán mujeres, todas te dicen ""Te quiero""
Pero cuando tienes nada la gente trata culero
Por eso camino solo, y de nadie nada espero
Soy el vago del vecindario que todos vieron pa’ abajo
El que vestía prendas usadas y trataron del carajo
Del que todos se burlaron y mil puertas le cerraron
Al que todos humillaban y hasta el agua le negaron
Hoy las cosas han cambiado, hoy me hice muy respetadoEmbed",

Meant to wash me away
A tide that is taking me under
Swallowing sand
Left with nothing to say
My voice drowned out in the thunder

But I won't cry
And I won't start to crumble
Whenever they try
To shut me or cut me down

I won't be silenced
You can't keep me quiet
Won't tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless

'Cause I'll breathe
When they try to suffocate me
Don't you underestimate me
'Cause I know that I won't go speechless

Written in stone
Every rule, every word
Centuries old and unbending
Stay in your place
Better seen and not heard
But now that story is ending
'Cause I
I cannot start to crumble
So come on and try
Try to shut me and cut me down

I won't be silenced
You can't keep me quiet
Won't tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless
Speechless

Let the storm in
I cannot be broken
No, I won't live unspoken
'Cause I know that I won't go speechless

Try to lock me in this cage
I won't just lay me down and die
I will take these broken wings
And watch me burn across the sky
Hear the echoes saying I

Won't be silenced
Though you want to see me tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless

'Cause I'll breathe
When they try to suffocate me
Don't you underestimate me

This lil' light of mine, I'm gon' let it shine
All she want is time, all she want is time
Look me in my eyes, call me on my lies
Lock the city down til' the summertime
Time to slice these niggas up some humble pie
Caravan of foreigns, let my youngin drive
Elevate my game for the hundredth time
You could hold me down through these troubled times
Or be another victim to my stubborn pride
Hold me down through these troubled times
Be another victim to my stubborn pride

Middle of the night kitchen lights is on
Roll me up a Bacc then I light the stove
Taught her stay calm when the crisis on
Say I die alone, I say my life a poem
Hyde Park Hussle speakin' hyperbole
Translation, get the money never wife a hoe
Clip is full already now it's time to go
Shoulder full already where these stripes should go
Crash got opinions how my life should go
I'm screaming, ""Fuck em',"" they could suck a dick and die tonight you know
Bullets, rain on em', cut the life support

Niggas dyin' every day, that's the price of war
Gang members spendin' thousands at the nicest stores
Levitate on five-star luxury, every time I ride shit come for me

On this gutter shit, I never hopped off, most calculated move by far
Always with a model and a fly car

Excitement that she get from pop life could never top mine
Once you get the hustle locked down, you can stockpile
Level up another notch now, like it's stock now
Every time I take the top down she arch her eyebrows
Turnin' up the music high now, she feel alive now
Love me like we from a small town, let's make a mall round
You splurge, I splurge
We ball later and we ball now

These bitches don't like me
These bitches wanna fight me
And doin' shit just to spite me
I see them talking on the IG
Think you jealous, maybe high key
I got the juice, I got the Hi-C
Do I care? Unlikely

[Verse 1]
You must have time on your hands
'Cause all the time you been hatin'
I know you're mad that I'm famous
I know you're mad that I made it
When all the time you been hatin'
You could've turned into something
Sometimes it works out for people
Sometimes it really just doesn't
Don't do this shit to be famous
I do this shit 'cause I love it
I shot an arrow said, ""Fuck it""
I took a chance, came from nothing
You have to go for it, want it
You have to rise up above it
If you go on expecting
Well girl, I think that you're buggin'
How you want what I have?
You ain't workin' yourself
That toxic energy shit
Ain't really good for your health
I think you need better goals
'Cause, oh my God, you seem lost
You talkin' shit 'bout my music
But what the fuck have you dropped?
Now what the fuck have you done?
Accolades, you have none
Your lazy ways get you none
I'll go and pray for you, hun

I'm on the train throwing soup
The racist men making threats
I'm not a gangster, but I can tell you I love to throw hands
On racists, bigots and scum
I don't like drama, it's dumb
I don't be fightin' no women
I don't be totin no guns
I hate domestic abusers
In fact, they all make me sick
This dude poured wine on my friend
I punched him straight in his shit
I got a real code of honor that I take seriously
If Colin Kaep' was a woman then I'd be dead on one knee
My revolution is soulful
I'm healing kids with my hands
I'm talkin' loving my people
Not fightin' bitches for bands
I got no hate in my heart
I think it's funny I rap
I did not bang in these streets
And I did not trap in the trap

I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody help
Changed your mind when I changed my life, better start believin' in myself
And we all out lookin' for, lookin' for God so we never see it in ourself
Shit, divine intervention move in stealth
It's hard to tell what the prayer compelled
You can find me dancin' in between the raindrops
Tryna find a way to make the pain stop
Overtime, on the graveyard
Got a nigga feeling brainwashed
My instability's trademark
Copy-written in all my decisions
This is not supposed to be a way of livin'
Turned my temple down into a prison, shit

Used to slide out the back without the neighbors knowin'
Pose for the picture with the pearly whites
Dead lens zoomin' in, catchin' all my strikes
Used to trade Jordan for some molly
And she gave me all I need for the night, forties suffice
Morally alright, but I need some advice

Twist it up, puttin' on OutKast

Yellow dress, who is you? Hollaback (Whoody-hoo)
Brought her here, Uber Black, sent her back, Uber Pool
She might get Olive Garden, pussy taste like Jamba Juice
Baby mama on my body, even more than my masseuse
Look, blessed and anointed (Facts), nigga, how you want it? (Brrat)
Don't make me call up Ghost, somebody gettin' haunted
Heard she fucked some other nigga, she just end up disappointed
Got these pussies pocket watchin', like our bank account is jointed
Look, before a nigga popped, I was sleeping on a cot
Look, now I got it lit, 100 watts in the spot
Look, know that I'm that nigga, but I be acting like I'm not

His last name was Flores
He came up from Juárez
Lookin' for a hell of a time
With a blonde señorita
And a tall margarita
We danced on the tables all night
Then I said, ""Adiós
Casamigos is taking me home tonight""

’Cause he don't love me like tequila does
Nobody can
He don't give me that border town buzz
Like tequila does

[Verse 2]
I’d sure like to find
A cowboy tonight
To get me back in the saddle
But the boys around here
Drink domestic beer
They're all hat, no cattle
But I won't sleep alone
'Cause my old pal Patrón
Is taking me home tonight

They don't love me like tequila does
Nobody can
They don't give me that border town buzz
Like tequila does

[Verse 3]
Well, I might as well face it
I'm always chasin'
A kiss with a twist of a lime
When I’m drinking doubles
I’m nothing but trouble
And trouble's so easy to find
Hand me a sombrero
’Cause Jose Cuervo
Is taking me home tonight

No, they don't love me like tequila does
Nobody can
They don't give me that border town buzz

It's knowing that it's flying away
And there's no way to slow it down
Instead of counting up the days
I just wanna make 'em count

[Verse 2]
I need to catch up with my sister
Our old jacket pins and stickers
Sometimes the bigger picture is in the little things
Hiding out in aisle three
In the CVS from that gossip queen
Who'd have told the whole town if she’d seen us acting fifteen
(Again)
[Pre-Chorus]
The other day it hit me like a hammer
That you can’t get back all those moments that really matter

[Chorus]
Another candle on a cake
Another month on a page
You blink, another year under the sun we all go 'round
It’s hello and goodbye and
It's knowing that it's flying away
And there's no way to slow it down
Instead of counting up the days
I just wanna make ’em count

[Bridge]
I don't want 'em to add up to nothing
Make 'em count
'Cause if it's all I got I want 'em to mean something

[Chorus]
Every candle on a cake
Every month on a page
You blink, another year under the sun we all go 'round
Hello and goodbye and
I know that they're flying away
And there's no way to slow 'em down
Instead of counting up the days
I just wanna make 'em count

Yeah, I just wanna make 'em countEmbed","lit  , cap  , tea  , tea  , tea  , "

You're feeling nervous, aren't you, boy?
With your quiet voice and impeccable style
Don't ever let them steal your joy
And your gentle ways, to keep 'em from running wild
They can kick dirt in your face
Dress you down, and tell you that your place
Is in the middle, when they hate the way you shine
I see you tugging on your shirt
Trying to hide inside of it and hide how much it hurts

Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them

You get discouraged, don't you, girl?
It's your brother's world for a while longer
You gotta dance with the devil on a river
To beat the stream
Call it living the dream, call it kicking the ladder
They come to kick dirt in your face
To call you weak and then displace you
After carrying your baby on your back across the desert
I saw your eyes behind your hair
And you're looking tired, but you don't look scared

Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind

4,Eyes. Lips. Face.,iLL Wayno,"The Lovely Bones (Chapter 9) LyricsMy grandmother arrived on the evening before my memorial in her usual style. She liked to hire limousines and drive in from the airport sipping champagne while wearing what she called her “thick and fabulous animal” – a mink she had gotten secondhand at the church bazaar. My parents had not so much invited her as included her if she wanted to be there. In late January, Principal Caden had initiated the idea. “It will be good for your children and all the students at school,” he had said. He took it upon himself to organize the event at our church. My parents were like sleepwalkers saying yes to his questions, nodding their heads to flowers or speakers. When my mother mentioned it on the phone to her mother, she was surprised to hear the words “I’m coming.”
“But you don’t have to, Mother.”
There was a silence on my grandmother’s end. “Abigail,” she said, “this is Susan’s funeral.”

Grandma Lynn embarrassed my mother by insisting on wearing her used furs on walks around the block and by once attending a block party in high makeup. She would ask my mother questions until she knew who everyone was, whether or not my mother had seen the inside of their house, what the husband did for a living, what cars they drove. She made a solid catalog of the neighbors. It was a way, I now realized, to try to understand her daughter better. A miscalculated circling, a sad, partnerless dance.
“Jack-y,” my grandmother said as she approached my parents on the front porch, “we need some stiff drinks!” She saw Lindsey then, trying to sneak up the stairs and gain a few more minutes before the required visitation. “Kid hates me,” Grandma Lynn said. Her smile was frozen, her teeth perfect and white.
“Mother,” my mother said. And I wanted to rush into those ocean eyes of loss. “I’m sure Lindsey is just going to make herself presentable.”
“An impossibility in this house!” said my grandmother.
“Lynn,” said my father, “this is a different house than last time you were here. I’ll get you a drink, but I ask you to respect that.”
“Still handsome as hell, Jack,” my grandmother said.
My mother took my grandmother’s coat. Holiday had been closed up in my father’s den as soon as Buckley had yelled from his post at the upstairs window – “It’s Grandma!” My brother bragged to Nate or anyone who would listen that his grandmother had the biggest cars in the whole wide world.
“You look lovely, Mother,” my mother said.
“Hmmmm.” While my father was out of earshot, my grandmother said, “How is he?”
“We’re all coping, but it’s hard.”
“Is he still muttering about that man having done it?”
“He still thinks so, yes.”
“You’ll be sued, you know,” she said.
“He hasn’t told anyone but the police.”
What they couldn’t see was that my sister was sitting above them on the top step.
“And he shouldn’t. I realize he has to blame someone, but…”
“Lynn, seven and seven or a martini?” my father said, coming back out into the hallway.
“What are you having?”
“I’m not drinking these days, actually,” my father said.
“Now there’s your problem. I’ll lead the way. No one has to tell me where the liquor is!”
Without her thick and fabulous animal, my grandmother was rail thin. “Starved down” was how she put it when she’d counseled me at age eleven. “You need to get yourself starved down, honey, before you keep fat on for too long. Baby fat is just another way to say ugly.” She and my mother had fought about whether I was old enough for benzedrine – her own personal savior, she called it, as in, “I am offering your daughter my own personal savior and you deny her?”
When I was alive, everything my grandmother did was bad. But an odd thing happened when she arrived in her rented limo that day, opened up our house, and barged in. She was, in all her obnoxious finery, dragging the light back in.
“You need help, Abigail,” my grandmother said after having eaten the first real meal my mother had cooked since my disappearance. My mother was stunned. She had donned her blue dishwashing gloves, filled the sink with sudsy water, and was preparing to do every dish. Lindsey would dry. Her mother, she assumed, would call upon Jack to pour her an after-dinner drink.
“Mother, that is so nice of you.”
“Don’t mention it,” she said. “I’ll just run out to the front hall and get my bag o’ magic.”
“Oh no,” I heard my mother say under her breath.
“Ah, yes, the bag o’ magic,” said Lindsey, who had not spoken the whole meal.
“Please, Mother!” my mother protested when Grandma Lynn came back.
“Okay, kids, clear off the table and get your mother over here. I’m doing a makeover.”
“Mother, that’s crazy. I have all these dishes to do.”
“Abigail,” my father said.
“Oh no. She may get you to drink, but she’s not getting those instruments of torture near me.”
“I’m not drunk,” he said.
“You’re smiling,” my mother said.
“So sue him,” Grandma Lynn said. “Buckley, grab your mother’s hand and drag her over here.” My brother obliged. It was fun to see his mother be bossed and prodded.
“Grandma Lynn?” Lindsey asked shyly.
My mother was being led by Buckley to a kitchen chair my grandmother had turned to face her.
“What?”
“Could you teach me about makeup?”
“My God in heaven, praise the Lord, yes!”
My mother sat down and Buckley climbed up into her lap. “What’s wrong, Mommy?”
“Are you laughing, Abbie?” My father smiled.
And she was. She was laughing and she was crying too.
“Susie was a good girl, honey,” Grandma Lynn said. “Just like you.” There was no pause. “Now lift up your chin and let me have a look at those bags under your eyes.”
Buckley got down and moved onto a chair. “This is an eyelash curler, Lindsey,” my grandmother instructed. “I taught your mother all of these things.”
“Clarissa uses those,” Lindsey said.
My grandmother set the rubber curler pads on either side of my mother’s eyelashes, and my mother, knowing the ropes, looked upward.
“Have you talked to Clarissa?” my father asked.
“Not really,” said Lindsey. “She’s hanging out a lot with Brian Nelson. They cut class enough times to get a three-day suspension.”
“I don’t expect that of Clarissa,” my father said. “She may not have been the brightest apple in the bunch, but she was never a troublemaker.”
“When I ran into her she reeked of pot.”
“I hope you’re not getting into that,” Grandma Lynn said. She finished the last of her seven and seven and slammed the highball glass down on the table. “Now, see this, Lindsey, see how when the lashes are curled it opens up your mother’s eyes?”
Lindsey tried to imagine her own eyelashes, but instead saw the star-clumped lashes of Samuel Heckler as his face neared hers for a kiss. Her pupils dilated, pulsing in and out like small, ferocious olives.
“I stand amazed,” Grandma Lynn said, and put her hands, one still twisted into the awkward handles of the eyelash curler, on her hips.
“What?”
“Lindsey Salmon, you have a boyfriend,” my grandmother announced to the room.
My father smiled. He was liking Grandma Lynn suddenly. I was too.
“Do not,” Lindsey said.
My grandmother was about to speak when my mother whispered, “Do too.”
“Bless you, honey,” my grandmother said, “you should have a boyfriend. As soon as I’m done with your mother, I’m giving you the grand Grandma Lynn treatment. Jack, make me an aperitif.”
“An aperitif is something you…” my mother began.
“Don’t correct me, Abigail.”
My grandmother got sloshed. She made Lindsey look like a clown or, as Grandma Lynn said herself, “a grade-A ’tute.” My father got what she called “finely drunkened.” The most amazing thing was that my mother went to bed and left the dirty dishes in the sink.
While everyone else slept, Lindsey stood at the mirror in the bathroom, looking at herself. She wiped off some of the blush, blotted her lips, and ran her fingers over the swollen, freshly plucked parts of her formerly bushy eyebrows. In the mirror she saw something different and so did I: an adult who could take care of herself. Under the makeup was the face she’d always known as her own, until very recently, when it had become the face that reminded people of me. With lip pencil and eyeliner, she now saw, the edges of her features were delineated, and they sat on her face like gems imported from some far-off place where the colors were richer than the colors in our house had ever been. It was true what our grandmother said – the makeup brought out the blue of her eyes. The plucking of the eyebrows changed the shape of her face. The blush highlighted the hollows beneath her cheekbones (“The hollows that could stand some more hollowing,” our grandmother pointed out). And her lips – she practiced her facial expressions. She pouted, she kissed, she smiled wide as if she too had had a cocktail, she looked down and pretended to pray like a good girl but cocked one eye up to see how she looked being good. She went to bed and slept on her back so as not to mess up her new face.

Mrs. Bethel Utemeyer was the only dead person my sister and I ever saw. She moved in with her son to our development when I was six and Lindsey five.
My mother said that she had lost part of her brain and that sometimes she left her son’s house and didn’t know where she was. She would often end up in our front yard, standing under the dogwood tree and looking out at the street as if waiting for a bus. My mother would sit her down in the kitchen and make tea for the two of them, and after she calmed her she would call her son’s house to tell them where she was. Sometimes no one was home and Mrs. Utemeyer would sit at our kitchen table and stare into the centerpiece for hours. She would be there when we came home from school. Sitting. She smiled at us. Often she called Lindsey “Natalie” and reached out to touch her hair.
When she died, her son encouraged my mother to bring Lindsey and me to the funeral. “My mother seemed to have a special fondness for your children,” he wrote.
“She didn’t even know my name, Mom,” Lindsey whined, as our mother buttoned up the infinite number of round buttons on Lindsey’s dress coat. Another impractical gift from Grandma Lynn, my mother thought.
“At least she called you a name,” I said.
It was after Easter, and a spring heat wave had set in that week. All but the most stubborn of that winter’s snow had seeped into the earth, and in the graveyard of the Utemeyers’ church snow clung to the base of the headstones, while, nearby, buttercup shoots were making their way up.
The Utemeyers’ church was fancy. “High Catholic,” my father had said in the car. Lindsey and I thought this was very funny. My father hadn’t wanted to come but my mother was so pregnant that she couldn’t drive. For the last few months of her pregnancy with Buckley she was unable to fit behind the wheel. She was so uncomfortable most of the time that we avoided being near her for fear we’d be thrown into servitude.
But her pregnancy allowed her to get out of what Lindsey and I couldn’t stop talking about for weeks and what I kept dreaming about for long after that: viewing the body. I could tell my father and mother didn’t want this to happen, but Mr. Utemeyer made beeline for the two of us when it was time to file past the casket. “Which one of you is the one she called Natalie?” he asked. We stared at him. I pointed to Lindsey.
“I’d like you to come say goodbye,” he said. He smelled of a perfume sweeter than what my mother sometimes wore, and the sting of it in my nose, and my sense of exclusion, made me want to cry. “You can come too,” he said to me, extending his hands so we would flank him in the aisle.
It wasn’t Mrs. Utemeyer. It was something else. But it was Mrs. Utemeyer too. I tried to keep my eyes focused on the gleaming gold rings on her fingers.
“Mother,” Mr. Utemeyer said, “I brought the little girl you called Natalie.”
Lindsey and I both admitted later that we expected Mrs. Utemeyer to speak and that we had decided, individually, that if she did we were going to grab the other one and run like hell.
An excruciating second or two and it was over and we were released back to our mother and father.
I wasn’t very surprised when I first saw Mrs. Bethel Utemeyer in my heaven, nor was I shocked when Holly and I found her walking hand in hand with a small blond girl she introduced as her daughter, Natalie.

The morning of my memorial Lindsey stayed in her room for as long as she could. She didn’t want my mother to see the still-applied makeup until it would be too late to make her wash it off. She had also told herself it would be okay to take a dress from my closet. That I wouldn’t mind.
But it was weird to watch.
She opened the door to my room, a vault that by February was being disturbed more and more, though no one, not my mother or father, nor Buckley or Lindsey, confessed to entering, nor to taking things that they didn’t plan on returning. They were blind to the clues that each of them came and visited me there. Any disturbance, even if it could not possibly be blamed on Holiday, was blamed on him.
Lindsey wanted to look nice for Samuel. She opened the double doors to my closet and reviewed the mess. I hadn’t been exactly orderly, so every time my mother told us to clean up, I’d shoved whatever was on the floor or bed into my closet.
Lindsey had always wanted the clothes I owned first-run but had gotten them all as hand-me-downs.
“Gosh,” she said, whispering into the darkness of my closet. She realized with guilt and glee that everything she saw before her was hers now.
“Hello? Knock-knock,” said Grandma Lynn.
Lindsey jumped.
“Sorry to disturb you, hon,” she said. “I thought I heard you in here.”
My grandmother stood in what my mother called one of her Jackie Kennedy dresses. She had never understood why unlike the rest of us her mother had no hips – she could slide into a straight-cut dress and fill it out just enough, even at sixty-two, to look perfect in it.
“What are you doing in here?” Lindsey asked.
“I need help with this zipper.” Grandma Lynn turned, and Lindsey could see what she had never seen on our own mother. The back of Grandma Lynn’s black bra, the top of her half-slip. She walked the step or two over to our grandmother and, trying not to touch anything but the zipper tab, zipped her up.
“How about that hook and eye up there,” said Grandma Lynn. “Can you get that?”
There were powdery smells and Chanel No. 5 sprinkled all around our grandmother’s neck.
“It’s one of the reasons for a man – you can’t do this stuff yourself.”
Lindsey was as tall as our grandmother and still growing. As he took the hook and eye in either hand, she saw the fine wisps of dyed blond hair at the base of my grandmother’s skull. She saw the downy gray hair trailing along her back and neck. She hooked the dress and then stood there.
“I’ve forgotten what she looked like,” Lindsey said.
“What?” Grandma Lynn turned.
“I can’t remember,” Lindsey said. “I mean her neck, you know, did I ever look at it?”
“Oh honey,” Grandma Lynn said, “come here.” She opened up her arms, but Lindsey turned into the closet.
“I need to look pretty,” she said.
“You are pretty,” Grandma Lynn said.
Lindsey couldn’t get her breath. One thing Grandma Lynn never did was dole out compliments. When they came, they were unexpected gold.
“We’ll find you a nice outfit in here,” Grandma Lynn said and strode toward my clothes. No one could shop a rack like Grandma Lynn. On the rare occasions that she visited near the start of the school year she would take the two of us out. We marveled at her as we watched her nimble fingers play the hangers like so many keys. Suddenly, hesitating only for a moment, she would pull out a dress or shirt and hold it up to us. “What do you think?” she’d ask. It was always perfect.
As she considered my separates, plucked and posed them against my sister’s torso, she talked:
“Your mother’s a wreck, Lindsey. I’ve never seen her like this before.”
“Grandma.”
“Hush, I’m thinking.” She held up my favorite church dress. It was blackwatch wool with a Peter Pan collar. I liked it mostly because the skirt was so big I could sit in the pew cross-legged and flounce the hem down to the ground. “Where did she get this sack?” my grandmother asked. “Your dad, he’s a mess too, but he’s mad about it.”
“Who was that man you asked Mom about?”
She stiffened on the question. “What man?”
“You asked Mom if Dad still was saying that that man did it. What man?”
“Voila!” Grandma Lynn held up a dark blue minidress that my sister had never seen. It was Clarissa’s.
“It’s so short,” Lindsey said.
“I’m shocked at your mother,” Grandma Lynn said. “She let the kid get something stylish!”
My father called up from the hallway that he expected everyone downstairs in ten minutes.
Grandma Lynn went into preparation overdrive. She helped Lindsey get the dark blue dress over her head, and then they ran back to Lindsey’s room for shoes, and then, finally, in the hallway, under the overhead light, she fixed the smudged eyeliner and mascara on my sister’s face. She finished her off with firmly pressed powder, whisking the cotton pad lightly in an upward direction along either side of Lindsey’s face. It wasn’t until my grandmother came downstairs and my mother commented on the shortness of Lindsey’s dress while looking suspiciously at Grandma Lynn that my sister and I realized Grandma Lynn didn’t have a spot of makeup on her own face. Buckley rode between them in the back seat, and as they neared the church he looked at Grandma Lynn and asked what she was doing.
“When you don’t have time for rouge, this puts a little life into them,” she said, and so Buckley copied her and pinched his cheeks.
Samuel Heckler was standing by the stone posts that marked the path to the church door. He was dressed all in black, and beside him his older brother, Hal, stood wearing the beat-up leather jacket Samuel had worn on Christmas Day.
His brother was like a darker print of Samuel. He was tanned, and his face was weathered from riding his motorcycle full-tilt down country roads. As my family approached, Hal turned quickly and walked away.
“This must be Samuel,” my grandmother said. “I’m the evil grandma.”
“Shall we go in?” my father said. “It’s nice to see you, Samuel.”
Lindsey and Samuel led the way, while my grandmother dropped back and walked on the other side of my mother. A united front.
Detective Fenerman was standing by the doorway in an itchy-looking suit. He nodded at my parents and seemed to linger on my mother. “Will you join us?” my father asked.
“Thank you,” he said, “but I just want to be in the vicinity.”
“We appreciate that.”
They walked into the cramped vestibule of our church. I wanted to snake up my father’s back, circle his neck, whisper in his ear. But I was already there in his every pore and crevice.
He had woken up with a hangover and turned over on his side to watch my mother’s shallow breathing against the pillow. His lovely wife, his lovely girl. He wanted to place his hand on her cheek, smooth her hair back from her face, kiss her – but sleeping, she was at peace. He hadn’t woken a day since my death when the day wasn’t something to get through. But the truth was, the memorial service day was not the worst kind. At least it was honest. At least it was a day shaped around what they were so preoccupied by: my absence. Today he would not have to pretend he was getting back to normal – whatever normal was. Today he could walk tall with grief and so could Abigail. But he knew that as soon as she woke up he would not really look at her for the rest of the day, not really look into her and see the woman he had known her to be before the day they had taken in the news of my death. At nearly two months, the idea of it as news was fading away in the hearts of all but my family – and Ruth.
She came with her father. They were standing in the corner near the glass case that held a chalice used during the Revolutionary War, when the church had been a hospital. Mr. and Mrs. Dewitt were making small talk with them. At home on her desk, Mrs. Dewitt had a poem of Ruth’s. On Monday she was going to the guidance counselor with it. It was a poem about me.
“My wife seems to agree with Principal Caden,” Ruth’s father was saying, “that the memorial will help allow the kids to accept it.”
“What do you think?” Mr. Dewitt asked.
“I think let bygones be bygones and leave the family to their own. But Ruthie wanted to come.”
Ruth watched my family greet people and noted in horror my sister’s new look. Ruth did not believe in makeup. She thought it demeaned women. Samuel Heckler was holding Lindsey’s hand. A word from her readings popped into her head: subjugation. But then I saw her notice Hal Heckler through the window. He was standing out by the oldest graves in the front and pulling on a cigarette butt.
“Ruthie,” her father asked, “what is it?”
She focused again and looked at him. “What’s what?”
“You were staring off into space just now,” he said.
“I like the way the graveyard looks.”
“Ah kid, you’re my angel,” he said. “Let’s grab a seat before the good ones get taken.”
Clarissa was there, with a sheepish-looking Brian Nelson, who was wearing a suit of his father’s. She made her way up to my family, and when Principal Caden and Mr. Botte saw her they fell away and let her approach.
She shook hands with my father first.
“Hello, Clarissa,” he said. “How are you?”
“Okay,” she said. “How are you and Mrs. Salmon?”
“We’re fine, Clarissa,” he said. What an odd lie, I thought. “Would you like to join us in the family pew?”
“Um” – she looked down at her hands – “I’m with my boyfriend.”
My mother had entered some trancelike state and was staring hard at Clarissa’s face. Clarissa was alive and I was dead. Clarissa began to feel it, the eyes boring into her, and she wanted to get away. Then Clarissa saw the dress.
“Hey,” she said, reaching out toward my sister.
“What is it, Clarissa?” my mother snapped.
“Um, nothing,” she said. She looked at the dress again, knew she could never ask for it back now.
“Abigail?” my father said. He was attuned to her voice, her anger. Something was off.
Grandma Lynn, who stood just a bit behind my mother, winked at Clarissa.
“I was just noticing how good Lindsey looked,” Clarissa said.
My sister blushed.
The people in the vestibule began to stir and part. It was the Reverend Strick, walking in his vestments toward my parents.
Clarissa faded back to look for Brian Nelson. When she found him, she joined him out among the graves.
Ray Singh stayed away. He said goodbye to me in his own way: by looking at a picture – my studio portrait – that I had given him that fall.
He looked into the eyes of that photograph and saw right through them to the backdrop of marbleized suede every kid had to sit in front of under a hot light. What did dead mean, Ray wondered. It meant lost, it meant frozen, it meant gone. He knew that no one ever really looked the way they did in photos. He knew he didn’t look as wild or as frightened as he did in his own. He came to realize something as he stared at my photo – that it was not me. I was in the air around him, I was in the cold mornings he had now with Ruth, I was in the quiet time he spent alone between studying. I was the girl he had chosen to kiss. He wanted, somehow, to set me free. He didn’t want to burn my photo or toss it away, but he didn’t want to look at me anymore, either. I watched him as he placed the photograph in one of the giant volumes of Indian poetry in which he and his mother had pressed dozens of fragile flowers that were slowly turning to dust.
At the service they said nice things about me. Reverend Strick. Principal Caden. Mrs. Dewitt. But my father and mother sat through it numbed. Samuel kept squeezing Lindsey’s hand, but she didn’t seem to notice him. She barely blinked. Buckley sat in a small suit borrowed for the occasion from Nate, who had attended a wedding that year. He fidgeted and watched my father. It was Grandma Lynn who did the most important thing that day.
During the final hymn, as my family stood, she leaned over to Lindsey and whispered, “By the door, that’s him.”
Lindsey looked over.
Standing just behind Len Fenerman, who was now inside the doorway and singing along, stood a man from the neighborhood. He was dressed more casually than anyone else, wearing flannel-lined khaki trousers and a heavy flannel shirt. For a moment Lindsey thought she recognized him. Their eyes locked. Then she passed out.
In all the commotion of attending to her, George Harvey slipped between the Revolutionary War gravestones behind the church and walked away without being noticed.1Embed","bet , bet , bet , bet , bet , bet , af  , af  , af  , af  , af  , lit  , lit  , lit  , shook  , tea  , tea  , tea  , woke , woke , woke , stan "

I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't have a fuck to give, I've been moving state to state
In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from you, man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 1: Drake, Drake & Sampha, Sampha]
Then that phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said ""no strings attached"" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 2: Drake, Drake & Sampha]
She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
[Outro: Drake, Sampha]
Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
I guess that's just the motion
Talking to you is not enough, no
I guess that’s just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

I've seen dark before
But not like this
This is cold
This is empty
This is numb
The life I knew is over
The lights are out
Hello, darkness
I'm ready to succumb

[Verse 2: Anna]
I follow you around
I always have
But you've gone to a place I cannot find
This grief has a gravity
It pulls me down
But a tiny voice whispers in my mind
""You are lost, hope is gone
But you must go on
And do the next right thing""

[Verse 3: Anna]
Can there be a day beyond this night?
I don't know anymore what is true
I can't find my direction, I'm all alone
The only star that guided me was you
How to rise from the floor
When it's not you I'm rising for?
Just do the next right thing
Take a step, step again
It is all that I can to do
The next right thing
[Bridge: Anna]
I won't look too far ahead
It's too much for me to take
But break it down to this next breath
This next step
This next choice is one that I can make

[Verse 4: Anna]
So I'll walk through this night
Stumbling blindly toward the light
And do the next right thing
And with the dawn, what comes then
When it's clear that everything will never be the same again?
Then I'll make the choice
To hear that voice
And do the next right thing3Embed",
11,The Place Where Lost Things Go ,Emily Blunt,"The Place Where Lost Things Go Lyrics[MARY POPPINS]
Do you ever lie
Awake at night?
Just between the dark
And the morning light
Searching for the things
You used to know
Looking for the place
Where the lost things go

Do you ever dream
Or reminisce?
Wondering where to find
What you truly miss
Well maybe all those things
That you love so
Are waiting in the place
Where the lost things go

Memories you've shared
Gone for good you feared
They're all around you still
Though they've disappeared
Nothing's really left
Or lost without a trace
Nothing's gone forever
Only out of place
So maybe now the dish
And my best spoon
Are playing hide and seek
Just behind the moon
Waiting there until
It's time to show
Spring is like that now
Far beneath the snow
Hiding in the place
Where the lost things go

Time to close your eyes
So sleep can come around
For when you dream you'll find
All that's lost is found
Maybe on the moon
Or maybe somewhere new
Maybe all you're missing lives inside of you

So when you need her touch
And loving gaze
Gone but not forgotten
Is the perfect phrase
Smiling from a star
That she makes glow
Trust she's always there
Watching as you grow
Find her in the place
Where the lost things goEmbed","bet , "
36,The Purple People Eater,Sheb Wooley,"The Purple People Eater LyricsAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!!

Well, I saw the thing comin' out of the sky
It had a-one long horn and one big eye. (Ooh!)
I commenced to shakin' and I said, ""Ooh-eee!
It looks like a purple people eater to me!""

It was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
(One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater)
A one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
Sure looks strange to me (One eye?)

Well, he came down to earth and he lit in a tree
I said, ""Mr. Purple People Eater, don't eat me!""
I heard him say in a voice so gruff:
""I wouldn't eat you 'cause you're so tough.""

It was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater
Sure looks strange to me (One horn?)

I said, ""Mr. Purple People Eater, what's your line?""
He said, ""Eatin' purple people and it sure is fine
But that's not the reason that I came to land
I wanna get a job in a rock and roll band.""
Well bless my soul, rock and roll, flyin' purple people eater
Pigeon-toed, undergrowed, flyin' purple people eater
(We wear short shorts)
Friendly little people eater
What a sight to see! (Oooh!)

And then he swung from the tree and he lit on the ground
He started to rock, really rockin' around
It was a crazy ditty with a swingin' tune
Sing a bop bap aboopa lappa loom bam boom

Well bless my soul, rock and roll, flyin' purple people eater
Pigeon-toed, undergrowed, flyin' purple people eater
""I like short shorts""
Flyin' little people eater
What a sight to see! (Purple People?)

And then he went on his way, and then what do ya know
I saw him last night on a TV show
He was blowing it out, a'really knockin' em dead
Playin' rock and roll music through the horn in his head

""Hey, Nate, how's life?""
I don’t know, it's alright
I've been dealin’ with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night (Last night)
""I'm sorry,"" that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides, yeah (Bus rides)
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out
Somethin' funny’s goin’ on up in my house
Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know, pack my cart, take a new route
Clean up my yard, get the noose out
Hang up my heart, let it air out (Air out)
I’ve been searchin'
""What does that mean, Nate?"" I've been learning
Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavin’ my burdens
Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view, like this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey (But hey)
It's worth it, though
Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats
It's been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam
Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
Pretty vivid; I admit it, I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it? (You seen it?)
Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that, you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
Forget what I'm sayin', and—
Where'd the beat go?
Oh, ain't that somethin'?
Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach
Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face, clean off my vomit
OCD, tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it, now y'all done it
I can be critical, never typical
Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal
Intimate, but never political, pretty visual
Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though
You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful
Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (Videos, videos, videos)
Yeah, the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
Then it comes up outta nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great—not because you're not, but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith, woo
I've been developin', take a look at the benefits
Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence
Pretty evident; dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah (Ah)
It's that time again
Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in
Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big
On a road right now that I can't predict
Tell me ""Tone that down,"" but I can't resist
Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist

Wrap the turkey up in aluminum foil

Turkey and sweet potato pie

Got a lot up on my mind
These days they don't fuck with you unless you press rewind
Switchin' up the 808, we bouncin' all the time
Racks inside my backpack, that's your girlfriend on my line
These days all I wanna do is press the line
These nights workin', and you know we 'bout to fly
Lately I been thinkin' 'bout you when you on my mind

Tell me what you know about dreams (About dreams)
Tell me what you know about nightmares, nothin'
Know this life ain't always what it seems
No this life ain't always what it, what it, ayy

One time, two time, three time
Got a lotta money, but I got no me time

Up late night, met The Roots on Fallon
Everybody wonder why the boy stay wildin'
Never give a damn, no I never give a damn
I'm the man with the plan, yeah, you know who I am
Walk up in it and everybody know who I am
Now they wanna show love, now they wanna be fam
But I told you in the beginnin', I never give a damn
Money so tall, I'ma need a rubber band (Ah!)
Too much to count, too much to count, too much to count
Tell God I'ma need another hand
Too much pussy in the world, goddamn
Baby girl, know I love you, but you need another man
Mind on my money and my money on my mind
Feelin' fine, one of a kind, been ill with the rhyme
Silas from the 'Burg, from the home of the Terrapins (Woo!)
Boy blowin' up like a terrorist (Goddamn!)
That don't mean that he gotta speak Arabic
World so PC, I'ma need a therapist
Mama! Ayy, look at me one mo' 'gain
On top of my game, yeah, that's word to my kin
On top of the game, yeah, that's word to my gan
If I had a opportunity, I'd do it all again
Comin' for the head, buckshot, I win
I don't play games, I star in 'em
That's word to Naughty Dog
That's word to Last of Us
Bobby Boy slow it down, rappin' too fast for us, I'ma keep goin'
I'm knowin, I'm passin' the torch to the boy, now go in!
[Chorus: Silas]
These days all I got is money on my mind
Late night walkin' down the street, it's never fine
When we hit the stu', they say, ""Your boy one of a kind""
Maskin' my emotions, baby girl, say what you find

Um, she want control, alt, delete

She like, ""Oh yeah, of course,"" why she all on my shtick?
But she do not drive, she want me to show feet

No strings attached, but you want shit from me
Balmains and Margiela, little bitch, are you a dummy?
I ain't crashing on that pussy if it's wet for only money
I'm like, ""Oh, that's a thot, put it in a box""
Bitch kick rocks, give me back all my socks
Oh, that's a thot
She give me top if I feed her some clout
Bitch, hop off of my cock

That's a bop (That's a bop)
Give me my jacket (Give me my jacket) and then get out (Adios)
I ain't got the time, I ain't even got a ring (What?)
You'll prolly fuck the team if somebody slide you a lil' bean, ho
Load me a lil' choppa if you talkin' all that flexin'
Get up out my section, act like I can't see you messin'
All that love that you was talkin', with a hubby in the Basas’

On the seat, no cap, and I don't play pretend (Facts)

Hop out the Porsche, got in the 'Rari just to switch it up (Skrrt)
Zero to sixty, 2.8, I paddle shifted up
West Hollywood, little model, she got a nip and tuck (Facts)
Got her vagina rejuvenated, it's a different fuck (Bitch)
Me and London pullin' up in these Lambo trucks (That's a fact)
Spent ten thousand while you throw your little hundred bucks (Broke ass)
That really was a splurge? I mean you broke as fuck (Broke ass)
It's raining game, get a poncho, come and soak it up
Really, I mean for real, like where they do that?
In the Bay, we say, ""Yee,"" in New Orleans, they say, ""Who dat?""

On the side of the road, what's the risk? Roll the dice
If they catch us, I don't care 'cause we all gon' die (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, we all gon' die
I was worried, to be honest, but it's all goin' right
When I first laid eyes, I was awful enticed
And I might be off something, but I'm all in now
She gotta call in now
I don't think that you should work tomorrow
She said, ""First of all
I'm still goin' in,"" like Rich Homie Quan
But with you and me, God, man, it feels so intense
I already seen that movie but I will go again with you
I got a few I been tending to
But tonight, I forgot all about 'em

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Through the night
I would try to get it tonight
Yeah, the phone on my head like, ""You better do right""
I'm alone in the bed, yeah, I know what you said
Better cope with it
Don't take me for a joke and I won't get a friend that's tryna be more than that
I'm convinced that it's sorta that
When I seen you in the pics, I could tell you was forcin' that
I got time for this
Minus the bullshit, I'm cool now, look at my common sense
And I'm just realizing this
Know my soul isn't trapped
But what's holding me back is the old me, in fact
I'ma get intact, I'ma get it back
Mama, hold me to that
Just, just, just hold me to that
On stack, me and Jack got the city on smack
That's word, huh, that's words
Used to catch 18 all the way to Newburg
It was only me and her, I don't care what you heard
Only me and her, I don't care what you heard
Got a Southern accent, she'll slur a few words

Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I’m changing
I just need...

[Verse 1]
A little time to show you I'm worth it
I know that I can be a difficult person
I'm a stress case, drive you up the wall when I’m workin'
Actually, I'm probably worse when I'm not, you don't deserve it
Make you nervous 'cause you know I'ma break soon
Every time I do, I say somethin' that hurts you
Actin’ like I’m gone, but we both in the same room
I don't like to be wrong, which I know you relate to
And I know I make you feel like you’re at the end of your rope
That's when I look at you and tell you I'd be better alone
Just the pride talkin', isn’t it? 'Cause both of us know
I'm the definition of ""wreck"" if you look into my soul
Comes out the most when I feel I'm in a vulnerable place
Made a lot of mistakes I wish I knew how to erase
When I'm afraid, might get distant and I push you away
But no matter the case, I'ma do whatever it takes even if—

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright

Yeah, way before I bought you the ring
We were fighting back and forth like you were wearin' the thing
Two passionate people not afraid to say what they think
Lead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree
You know me well, sittin' on the edge of my seat
Lookin' at life, overanalyzin' everything
Always depressed, tryna find a better version of me
Searching for somethin' I know's prolly right in front of my feet
Stubborn as me? Maybe not, but you're close to it
Got a lot of issues, I'm tryin' to work through 'em
Going to therapy for you's somethin' that's worth doin'
When I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments
And I know it hurts knowing that I carry this weight on my chest
Making it difficult for me to open up and connect
Lot of regrets, I apologize for all of the stress
That's not what I meant to do, you know I love you to death even if—

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry

Doctor Love
Doctor Love
Doctor Love
[Verse 2]
Living life in darkness, this fight is full of nonsense
Trying to navigate through my mistakes
But ever since I met someone who taught me that love is like a party
I can never dim the lights again

[Pre-Chorus]
And just give me some love
'Cause I'm running out of that feeling
Doctor, prescribe me that drug
'Cause I need some more of your healing

[Chorus]
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
Baby, turn me on, turn me on (Healing)
You know just what I needed, Doctor Love

Ya no tiene excusa (No, no)
Hoy salió con su amiga dizque pa' matar la tusa (Ah; tusa)
Que porque un hombre le pagó mal (Ah)
Está dura y abusa (Eh)
Se cansó de ser buena
Ahora es ella quien los usa (Hmm-mm)
Que porque un hombre le pagó mal (Mal)
Ya no se le ve sentimental (-tal)
Dice que por otro man no llora, no (Llora)

Llorando lo comienza a llamar
Pero él la dejó en buzón (-zón)
¿Será porque con otra está (Con otra está)
Fingiendo que a otra se puede amar?
[Verso 2: Nicki Minaj]
Pero hice todo este llanto por nada
Ahora soy una chica mala
And now you kickin' and screamin', a big toddler
Don't try to get your friends to come holla, holla (Holla)

'Cause I know I'm the baddest bitch that you ever really met (Oop!)
You searchin' for a badder bitch, and you ain't met her yet (Oop!)

Couldn't get enough (Couldn't get enough)
Had to get you straight to my bedroom
Drank still in my cup (My cup)
Crib is large so you can bring your friends, too (Well, bring 'em all)
Pillow full of makeup
She so bad, she gon' need her own debut (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Shawty just like me (She like me)
Loves drugs, hates bein' sober (Hate bein' sober)
In my psyche (She in my head)
In my heart and I didn't even know her
Ass you wouldn't believe (You wouldn't believe it)
See you in those jeans, wanna pull you closer
Eyes are looking Chinese (She Chinese)
She didn't smoke, but now she's a stoner (All day)
Everything unique (Everything)
No, no, no mediocre
Young, wild and free (She free)
No cuffs, so, no, you can't control her (No cuffs)
Body covered in ink (In ink)
I can beat it up, or we can just go slower (Slow it down)
Baby, come with me (Come with me)
I'll give you everything, and it'll never be over
Girl, just let me know (Let me know)
We can go and fuck up some commas

Imagine this comin' from the bottom
Actin' like she don't (She don't)
Tryna front, we know she wanna (We know)
Baby, we can go (We can go), Acapulco to Tijuana

We just livin' it up (Live it up)
Having fun, give a fuck what y'all say (Give a fuck what y'all say)
Shawty loves a thug (Yeah)
Matching whips as we dippin' down Broadway
Sparkin' like a blunt (Spark it up)
She dab it up, and I be rollin' up all day (Let's roll it up)
No coffee in my mug (No coffee)
They be askin' why I lookin' so sloshy
When we locked eyes (Locked eyes)
Know you were mine, didn't have to ask you
Fuck them other guys (Fuck 'em)
I'll give you everything, and we can split this cash, too
Feelin' like a dream (Like a dream)
Tell me what you need and I can make that happen (I do that)
Love the ocean breeze (I love it)
All aboard, and I'ma be your captain (All aboard)
Mixtape on repeat (It is)
When the boy come on, they like, ""Who's that rappin'?""
House like a retreat (Like a retreat)
I come from the hood, no, not the Hamptons
Never wanna leave (Never wanna)
I give you ecstasy, and a little thug's passion (Passion)
Apostle on my sleeve (On my sleeve)
What you like? I got the latest fashion
Coolin', watchin' T.V. (Chillin')
Blowing clouds, lookin' like a dragon (Dragon)
All she want is me (Just me)
In silk sheets, no, no, not satin (Silk, man)
I think you're the one (The one)
Tell me what you want, don't care what the cost is
Can't say that I'm sprung (Can't say it)
But if you keep this up, might be my fiancé

You was at the club (The club)
Bottoms up when I first met you
Couldn't get enough (Enough)
Had to get you straight to my bedroom
Drank still in my cup

Pillow full of makeup
She so bad, she gon' need her own debut (Yeah)

De un verano eterno me enamoré
Y esa despedida en septiembre, en octubre sí que se siente
Noviembre sin ti me dolió también

Llegará diciembre, sigues en mi mente
Fueron seis meses y por fin volveré a verte
Llegará febrero, yo seré el primero
En darte flores y decirte que te quiero

Puede que pase un año más de una vez
Sin que te pueda ver, pero el amor es más fuerte
Puede que el tiempo nos aleje otra vez
Sin saber dónde estés, pero el amor es más fuerte
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Te esperaré porque el amor es más fuerte

Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm
Ya le dije a mis amigo':
""Yo no necesito a nadie, sólo tú estás en mi mente""
Mil kilómetros se restan
Cuando dos almas se suman, a los lejos puedo verte
Sólo pienso-sólo pienso en ti
Sólo pienso-sólo pienso en ti
Ya mis primos saben tu apellido
Que por ti yo estoy perdido
Espero que también te pase a ti

But I'm afraid of being sober
'Cause the first thing I do when I'm alone

I start touching myself to the photos that you used to send me
I should have deleted, but kept it a secret
Is that crazy to do?
So I squeeze out the lime on the ice of my drink
And the juice hits the cuts on my fingers
It still doesn't burn as much as the thought of you

[Chorus]
Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But some things you can't undo
And one of them's you
[Verse 2]
I'm afraid to turn the lights on
I don't wanna face this rebound
Is it weird if I come over?
I want to, but I know that she's around

So I'm touching myself to the photos that you used to send me
I should have deleted, but kept it a secret

It still doesn't burn as much as the thought of you

Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you

I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But some things you can't undo
And one of them's you

Been through every emotion
Right now, I'm sad and broken
Like the bottles on the floor, but I'm too buzzed to clean 'em up
Wish I could get a little un-drunk
So I could, I could un-love you

Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you

[Verse 1]
Thought you won't leave my side
But I guess you lied to me
I thought you was down to ride
But ain't nobody ride but me
And they all turned their backs on me
So I think it's time to say
My goodbye, to all of your lies
(Let me take that back)

[Pre-Chorus]
You gave me this feeling that I've never felt before
And I deserved it, I know I deserved it
It became somethin' that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it

[Chorus]
I was wonderin' maybe, can I have back my baby?
If I did somethin' special, would that make me look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready
Can I ask you, are you ready?

[Post-Chorus]
To see the new me (Woah)
I changed 'cause you're my everything, my everything
[Verse 2]
You told me I was the first you ever felt in love with
And I can say the same about you
People in my past, they did me dirty, broke my heart
But when I came across you, you were different
I was wonderin', can I fix my mistakes?
'Cause baby...

[Chorus]
I was wonderin' maybe, can I have back my baby?
If I did somethin' special, would that make me look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready
Can I ask you, are you ready?

People come and go, they’re all the same it seems
Got too many holes where lovers used to be
Can’t be good for me, but I don’t like to be alone, really
Storm headed south, missed me by a couple miles
I was almost in the mouth of trouble, I was excited
I wanna be afraid of something again
You either stick around till things fall apart
Or get the hell out of there early, wonder what could’ve been
I’m not saying I have a preference

[Chorus]
The worst thing you could do is leave, when I tell you, “Just go”
We both know I don’t want you to leave me alone
The worst thing you could do is leave, when I tell you, “Just go”
Don’t listen to me, don’t listen to me, no

[Verse 2]
It’s not your job to apologize for things that hurt me
Though I half expect you to know what will
Thought getting older would make me strong
And I’m tired, is it showing?
I wanna change my temperament and change my mind
But it’s hard to do when I’m set on something
And is that all, will you be going?
I need a sense of urgency that I hope you’ve got
For you to call me back even when I tell you not to
[Chorus]
The worst thing you could do is leave, when I tell you, “Just go”
We both know I don’t want you to leave me alone
The worst thing you could do is leave, when I tell you, “Just go”

Flexin' hard, call me Popeye, wallet filled with spinach, ayy
Cut you off on the interstate, I'm first to finish, ayy

To the grave, might just be tomorrow, might just be today
So I always live it up, we poppin' bottles, poppin' K's
Gucci shades from my bougie bitch, I ain't even had to pay
Had to put on for the team and had to put on for the Bay
I'm still fly when I wear Robin's wings, I can't stay in one place
Russian Creams in my rocket ship, we go to outer space
Mask off, mask on, fuck it, I can't catch a case
Blast off, blast off, see the stars up in the Wraith
You can't get into the crib because the mansion got a gate
You can't come into my section, I'm gon' put you into place

And I think I fell in love, she shook that ass up in my face

Woah-oh
Woah-oh
Woah-oh
Like the beginning of Mean Streets, you could (Oh)
Like the beginning of Mean Streets, you could
Like the beginning of Mean Streets, you could

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle & Arctic Monkeys]
I'm prolific, so gifted
I'm the type that's gon' go get it, no kiddin'
Breaking down a Swisher front of your buildin'
Sitting on the steps, feeling no feelings
Last night, it was a cold killin'
You gotta keep the devil in his hole, nigga
But you know how it go, nigga
I'm front line every time it's on, nigga
Hunnid proof flow, run and shoot pro
458 drop, playin' ""Bullet Proof Soul""
Every few shows, I just buy some new gold
Circle got smaller, everybody can't go
Downtown, Diamond District, jewelers like, ""Yo
Hussle, holla at me, I got Cubans on the low""
Flew to Cancun, smokin' Cubans on the boat
Then docked at Tulum just to smoke, look
Listening to music at the Mayan Ruins
True devotion on the bluest ocean, cruisin'
My cultural influence even rival Lucien
I'm integrated vertically, y'all niggas blew it
They tell me, ""Hussle, dumb it down, you might confuse 'em""
This ain't that weirdo rap you motherfuckers used to
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
I'm an urban legend, South Central in a certain section
Can't express how I curved detectives
Guess it's evidence of a divine presence, blessings
Held me down, at times, I seem reckless, F it
You got an L, but got an E for effort, stretched him
Dropped him off in the Mojave desert, then left him
Ain't no answer to these trick questions
Money Makin' Nip, straighten out my jewelry on my bitch dresser
Well known, flick up and jail pose
Snatch a champagne bottle from Rico's 'til T show
Whatever, nigga, playin' chess, not checkers, nigga
Thirty-eight special for you clever niggas
See, bro, if you ain't live and die by the street code
Been through all these motions, up and down like a see-saw
I can never view you as my equal
Fuck I wanna hear your CD for?
[Chorus: Stacy Barthe & Arctic Monkeys]
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
Like the beginning of Mean Streets

Like the beginning of Mean Streets

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Yeah, look
I'm finna take it there
This time around, I'ma make it clear
Spoke some things into the universe and they appeared
I say it's worth it, I won't say it's fair
Find your purpose or you wastin' air
Fuck it, though, y'all niggas scared
Eyes opened, I can see it clear
They don't make 'em bar none, they don't make 'em real
They don't make it where I'm from, they don't take it here
They ain't see in due time, I be makin' mils
Bossed up in this game, I been makin' deals
Get your lawyer on the phone, we can make it real
I got checks and balance, I flex dramatic
Other fifty on my neck, just my reckless habit
Ain't no pussy on my rep, disrespect the savage
I make one phone call and the rest get handled
It's just another front step with candles
Lil' message from the set, ""We accept your challenge""

Woah-oh

You ain't got a clue, let's be honest
I had a couple seeds and made a forest
I put in the work and take the profit
Lookin' at my girl like, ""What a goddess"" (Thank God)
Rule number two, don't make the promise
If you can't keep the deal then just be honest (Just be honest)
I could never die, I'm Chuck Norris (Chuck Norris)
Fuck the government and fuck Boris (Yeah)
I'm a villain, killin' when I'm barrin'

Servicin' my whip, I phoned the boss to bring my car in
I could probably take your chick, but I just wouldn't 'cause she's jarrin', oh
I got the sauce (Sauce), don't know what you thought (Thoughts)
Catch me up in snowin' in my sliders and my shorts (Shorts)
Chicks tryna get my brother Flipz to share his thoughts
I think he's tryna tell me I should tell her he don't talk

Man, I wouldn't even try my luck with her
Gyal say I'm bougie (Word), way too exclusive (Word)
Chillin' in Dubai, know I get it all inclusive (Word)

And all this stress has got me wreckin' up my brain (Ayy, ayy)
So tell these likkle fishes back up off my name (Ayy, ayy)

My name Stiff Chocolate, I got nothing left to prove
I got holes in my lapel, rubbin' shoulders with your girl

Had to switch on a couple brodies talking bad on me

Ayy, shit's creek was deep, was with my peeps, we kept on paddlin'
Though was all on baby, know it's snakes who brought them rattles in
Fuck you heard? The cattle been lookin' like lunch, big crunch
Make you feel it in your core like the abdomen, I'm adamant
Yeah, kinda bent
Movement Uber extra, hope it got some tint
Nonchalant, not usually with the extra, just an excellent
Not the quick, this that long-haul like a corridor
Explore it more, got some keys that y'all adore
I too worked through sorrow and still had to borrow more
I might go tomorrow, you finish, I start it for us
True feelings show, villains grow, I Mighty Morph
Got too many loads, how it goes, I need more

Oh, they lie, but I keeps it honest (Gotta keep it all the way)
Oh, they try and I gets it done (Gotta get this done, okay)

Oh, what a life, what a life (Yeah, ayy)

[Verse 2: Saba]
Yesterday I was just in France
The day before that, we was scrambling just trying to get meals
Treating fast food like a five star
Check arrive and all of us split the bill
Some niggas cracking the card
I don't mean card in the crack like ""Tip Drill""
Free all my dawgs from the pack
Some of 'em caught in the act gotta sit still
Gwen Stefani, might tell 'em to holla' back
I heard life a bitch, but nah, I do not call her that
Trucker with the fit, my nigga, the starter pack
I heard when I spit that a nigga might get a chill, I brought it back
I tip my hat to the ones who were all forgotten
That got on they grind until they grew and didn't grow rotten
You sprout from the mud, that's what you do when you don't have options
When all of 'em duck and dodgin' truth, you would keep it honest, honest

I’m the wrong one for you
Smoking on my pain go to sleep
All this marijuana comfort me, comfort me
I hope my demons don’t come for me, come for me
Cocaine shorty had [?] for me

Tell the bros won’t believe what I just seen
She use her nose something out a movie scene
Tell me what’s the issue
I know that you ain’t supposed to do them type of drugs
What’s the reason, what’s the reason, what’s the issue?
Whoah girl don’t be claiming you in love
When you know you ain’t in no love

Why you looking at me?
Girl quit looking at me

Just don’t think that I care about
Anything you dropping [?] in my warehouse
I don’t get the logic anyway she let her hair down

My head is spinnin' like I've been out days
Now you're waking up too

Every single time I have to choose
Swore that it felt right, but was I wrong?
Is this where I'm supposed to be at all?
I don’t have the answers, not today
It's like nothing makes the questions go away

Would it be enough or would I still be wondering?

If I could go back and change the past
Be a little braver than I had
And bet against the odds
Would I still be lost?
Even if I woke up in my dreams
Would there still be something I'm missing?
If I had everything, would it mean anything to me?

All by my side
Argue, let's talk, I need you by my side
You had my back when the gang used to slide
Now you gone tell me you done with my time
I thought that I needed you in my life
All of them times that you talked, but you lied
Girl, you was down and you told me you roll like my Rollie
I'm done 'cause you lie with my guys, like nah
The only plan was to ball
Remember them times when we fall, but we got up and fought
I tried to leave, you would stall
Baby, I gave you my all, my all, my all
No car, we rode in the backseat
Yeah, you used to ride like a taxi
My heart fell so deep in the Black Sea
My heart fell so deep in the Black Sea

Girl, my mood changed when you walked through the door
Before you came, it was tears on the floor
Girl, you so perfect, I think that it's workin'
You gave me your love, now I really want more
Girl, you so different, apart from the rest
Cool, I dropped out, I don't really take tests
You gave me your love, I'm addicted like drugs

I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share

[Chorus]
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

Wakin' up at sundown (Ooh)
They're late to every party (Ooh)
Nobody's ever sorry (Ooh)
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down (Come down)
Their pretty heads are hurting (Hurting)
They're awfully bad at learning (Learning)
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance

I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone
Who isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake

One day, when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out
If it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He said, ""I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine""

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one
Girls there with round hair like Star Wars
Float above the floor
[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
We drove around in a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah, woo

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He said, ""I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doin' fine, doin' fine""

I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold Kelly Clarkson

She put my name with yellow hearts

I said she was a work of art (Work of art)
I didn't listen very hard (Very hard, no, no)
When she told me she was crazy from the start

I drive down open roads so slow
Here comes a train, I'll let it go
Ain't got nobody on my phone
Don't like being all alone (Don't like being all alone)
Not good at keeping with the trends (No, no)
Too good at welcoming amends
It's been a while since I've heard her say
That we were more than friends (Oh)
Oh, I, I-I-I, know a lot is going on
But girl, please tell me
And I'll let you be
Are you still with me or not?

I'm by the garden with the carpenter bees
Like I'm Bob Ross-in' with a Harden beard
Taking it all in like I got no issues in my nature
Primroses blooming in the night
Birds wanna take me on a flight
Appreciating my land 'fore it turns into a glacier
Chasers are of no good use
This taste will be long endured
Why'd you have to go so soon?
I thought this was as good as new

You lookin' for a Jason Lyric or a Love Jones?

Afraid to be in love, afraid to just be friends
I still remember when you used to call me up
Was broken-hearted, young, that nigga dogged you, huh?
Baby, don't hold no grudge, you know I hold you down
And if they ever try, I got a hundred rounds
Until the day we die, and then we in the sky

Remember me from this verse, I'm turnin' myself in

I didn't mean to hurt you
So why’d I let you walk out the door?
You say that you don't know me
You don't know who I am anymore
But if you knew the truth, then
Then you wouldn’t feel insecure
'Cause if I didn't have you
I wouldn't have nothing at all

I always forget that you can't read my mind

You’re all that I need
’Cause I want you and me, you and me

I know one day we'll look back
Stories on the tip of our tongues
A library full of pages
Remembering when we fell in love
All of the broken hearts and the stupid mistakes
Have got us to where we are, it was worth all the pain
Yeah, we’ll look back
We'll look back and laugh

I got 69 problems and cumming is not one (Yeah)
And my nigga fucked up so I'm 'bout to get some (Uh huh)
I just hit my boy toy and he comin’ around one (Where he at?)
I gave him that dumb tongue and clearly he’s still sprung, hmm
Ooh shit, it's ’bout to pop off
Put my hand on his dick and, girl, it was not soft (Uh huh)
Titties so big, he got lost in the ta-ta's
Lick his way down South, good thing I waxed my cha-cha
Venus fly trap when I make that ass clap (Yeah)
If you give me good dick, you ain't getting that back (Ooh)
Pull the microphone back, Jill Scott with the sack (Yass)

I got the fire on me in BET Awards
When your well run dry, you know you need me for it
When I pull up in the Buick, you know what I'm doin'
If the police get behind me, I'm fleein' and eludin'
Sleepin' on the palette turned me to a savage
I'm a project baby, now I stay in Calabasas
Like I still serve fiends, like I'm still jackin'
I be sippin' on lean, tryna keep balance
Hit that Z-Walk, Dickie's with my Reeboks
I don't say much, I just let the heat talk
Your jewelry water whip, diamonds like re-rock
My lil' baby ride the dick like a seesaw
When I stepped up on the scene, I was on a bean
When I jumped up out the Beam', I was in Celine
Baby girl, you just a fling, that ain't what I mean
