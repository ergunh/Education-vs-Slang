Once the data was put together, we imported it into a notebook using pandas, dropped all rows with missing data sets, and restricted it to the specfic columns that we are analyzing for this project. The dataset was quite usable on its own right with all of the datapoints we needed consolidated in a tidy format. We just needed to optimize it for easy analytics. Thus besides the above mentioned filtering of the dataset no transformations of the underlying data was neccesary. "

We will be doing data transformations like converting the CSV into JSON format in order to do comparisons likes compairng the geo location of the tweet to the the geo location of the county and its education level.
